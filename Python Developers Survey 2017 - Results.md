# Python Developers Survey 2017 Results

At the very end of 2017, the Python Software Foundation together with JetBrains conducted an official Python Developers Survey. We set out to identify the latest trends and gather insight into how the Python development world looks today. Over 9,500 developers from almost 150 different countries participated to help us map out an accurate landscape of the Python community.

## General Python Usage

### Python as Main vs Secondary Language

79%Main language

21%Secondary language

Almost 4 out of 5 Python developers use it as their main language, while for 21% it’s only a secondary language.

**Interesting fact**

This statistic is up 4% from 75% in 2016, when JetBrains conducted a [similar survey](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/python-developers-survey-2016/).

Half of all developers using Python as their main language also use JavaScript.

JavaScript is used by 79% of web developers, but only by 39% of those primarily involved in data analysis or machine learning. See the next section for insights into types of development.

The breakdown of languages is slightly different for those who use Python as their secondary language, with a little fewer developers using JavaScript (46%) but far more also using C/C++ (42%), Java (41%), and C# (24%).

## Types of Python Development

To identify the most popular types of Python development (a.k.a. developer roles) and how they are combined, we asked two similar but different questions: “What do you use Python for?” with multiple answers, followed by a single-answer “What do you use Python for the most?”.

### What do you use Python for? (multiple answers)

See all the results

Data analysis is as popular as web development with Python.

Web development is the only category with a large gap (54% vs 33%) separating those using Python as their main language vs as a supplementary language. For other types of development, the differences are far less significant.

**Interesting fact**

Various studies show that the number of Python developers is growing steadily year by year. The rapid growth of Python popularity can be explained by the fact that many people are starting to use Python for data science and machine learning. This is the fastest-growing segment of Python users.

Many Python developers wear multiple hats. We’ve identified the roles that they combine most often (not necessarily as their main ones):

24%

Data analysis

22%

+
DevOps / System administration

21%
Web development
+

15%

The intersection of data analysis and machine learning was expected, but the overlaps between web development and data analysis / machine learning are definitely noteworthy.

In this question, respondents could only select one option. At first glance, the results suggest that web development is a strong leader with 26%, beating Data analysis (18%) by a large margin. But if we take a closer look, there’s also Machine learning with 9%. If we bundle Data analysis and Machine learning together into a single ‘Data science’ category, this amounts to a stunning 27%.

Comparing the trends among those using Python as their main language vs a secondary language, web development has the biggest gap (29% vs 15%). For Data analysis and Machine learning, the difference is much smaller. Conversely, more DevOps and System administrators are using Python as a secondary language (13%) than as main language (8%).

| 26% | ≈   | 27% | (18% + 9%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web developers |     | Data scientists | (Data Analysis + Machine Learning) |

**Interesting fact**

In a [similar survey](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/python-developers-survey-2016/) that JetBrains ran in 2016, 38% of respondents identified as web developers and only 21% as data scientists.

There are as many Python web developers as Python data scientists.

### Is data science taking Python by storm?

The most intriguing question in this survey concerned the ratio of web developers to data scientists in the Python world. We asked respondents to think about the ratio between the total number of Python web developers in the world and the total number of data scientists using Python. Respondents could answer based on their own experience, beliefs, and general ‘gut feeling’. Because in this same survey we explicitly asked about types of development, and the sample size is large enough to be statistically significant, we could compare and check if the community was right about the correct ratio. Here’s what we got:

**What do you think is the ratio of these two numbers?**

Web developers

:

Data scientists

**1 : 10**

5%
**1 : 5**

13%
**1 : 2**

15%
**1 : 1**

11%
**2 : 1**

18%
**5 : 1**

25%
**10 : 1**

14%

As you can see, the most popular ratio is **5:1**. You can also notice that a larger part of respondents (57%) thought there are more web developers than data scientists, while only 33% assumed the opposite.

Note: Percentages total 101%

57%
Web developers
>
Data scientists

33%
Web developers
<
Data scientists

11%

=
Data scientists

Now, let’s revisit the types of development stats mentioned earlier. With **26%** doing web development as their primary activity, and **18%** primarily involved in data analysis **+ 9%** primarily doing machine learning, the ratio is in fact **1:1**! Only one in nine respondents guessed this correctly.

**Interesting fact**

Most respondents underestimated the total number of developers involved in data science. It's generally perceived that web development is the major application for Python. While this was true a couple of years ago, today the number of Python data scientists is growing rapidly and is already on par with the number of web developers.

## Python 3 vs Python 2

75%Python 3

25%Python 2

We asked, “Which version of Python do you use the most?”. Python 3 is a strong leader with 75% and Python 2 is used as the main interpreter by only 25%.

**Interesting fact**

The primary use of Python 3 is growing rapidly. According to the latest research in 2016, 60% were using Python 2 compared with 40% for Python 3. Use of Python 2 is declining as it’s not actively developed, doesn’t get new features, and its [maintenance is going to be stopped in 2020](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/).

**Python 3 Adoption**

**Note:** The adoption data for Python 3 covering previous years are derived from publicly available surveys: [2014](https://wiki.python.org/moin/2.x-vs-3.x-survey), [2015](http://zqpythonic.qiniucdn.com/data/20150131181628/index.html), and [2016](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/python-developers-survey-2016/).

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Python 3** | **Python 2** |
| 75% | 25% | All Python |
| 70% | 30% | Web developers |
| 80% | 20% | Data scientists |

**Probable cause**

A probable explanation is that some web developers still have lots of legacy code to maintain while transitioning to Python 3. On the other hand, many data analysts and machine learning specialists have joined the Python ecosystem just recently and went straight to the latest Python 3.

Another interesting finding is that only 70% of those mainly doing web development are using Python 3, while for data analysts this goes up to 77%, and for Machine learning specialists an even higher 83%.

Django is the most popular framework used by 41% of Python developers.

Scientific packages such as NumPy/Pandas/Matplotlib, taken together, are in close second with 39%. In terms of roles, Django was selected by 76% of web developers, but only by 31% of those involved primarily in data science. Curiously, 29% of web developers are using scientific libraries. This corroborates a strong overlap between the two roles.

### What additional technology(s) do you use in addition to Python? (multiple answers)

Jupyter Notebook is the most popular technology used together with Python.

This is expected given the large number of developers involved in data science. Docker trails it by only 2%, at 29%. Breaking this down by roles, Docker is used by 47% of those mostly involved in web development, but only by 23% of data scientists. Similarly, cloud platforms such as AWS, Google App Engine, Heroku and others are used twice as often by web developers than by data scientists.
