IPFS is the Distributed Web

## The web of tomorrow needs IPFS **today**

##### **HTTP is inefficient and expensive**

HTTP downloads a file from a single computer at a time, instead of getting pieces from multiple computers simultaneously. [With video delivery, a P2P approach could save 60% in bandwidth costs.](http://math.oregonstate.edu/~kovchegy/web/papers/p2p-vdn.pdf)

IPFS makes it possible to distribute high volumes of data with high efficiency. And zero duplication means savings in storage.

##### **Humanity's history is deleted daily**

[The average lifespan of a web page is 100 days.](https://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2011/11/the-average-lifespan-of-a-webpage/) Remember GeoCities? The web doesn't anymore. It's not good enough for the primary medium of our era to be so fragile.

IPFS provides historic versioning (like git) and makes it simple to set up resilient networks for mirroring of data.

##### **The web's centralization limits opportunity**

The Internet has been one of the great equalizers in human history and a real accelerator of innovation. But the increasing consolidation of control is a threat to that.

IPFS remains true to the original vision of the open and flat web, but delivers the technology which makes that vision a reality.

##### **Our apps are addicted to the backbone**

Developing world. Offline. Natural disasters. Intermittent connections. All trivial compared to interplanetary networking. The networks we're using are so 20th Century. We can do better.

IPFS powers the creation of diversely resilient networks which enable persistent availability with or without Internet backbone connectivity.

### IPFS aims to replace HTTP and

build a better web for all of us.

## Here's how IPFS works

##### Let's take a look at what happens when you add files to IPFS:

##### Each file and all of the **blocks within it** are given a **unique fingerprint** called a **cryptographic hash**.

##### IPFS **removes duplications** across the network and tracks **version history** for every file.

##### Each **network node** stores only content it is interested in, and some indexing information that helps figure out who is storing what.

##### When **looking up files**, you're asking the network to find nodes storing the content behind a unique hash.

##### Every file can be found by **human-readable names** using a decentralized naming system called **IPNS**.

## IPFS is useful here and now

##### Archivists

It's not enough to organize the world's information—we need to store it in a way the world can remember it. IPFS provides deduplication, high performance, and clustered persistence.

##### Service providers

If your company delivers large amounts of data to users, a peer-to-peer approach could save you millions in bandwidth. IPFS can provide secure P2P content delivery.

##### Researchers

If you're working with, distributing, and analyzing huge datasets, IPFS offers fast performance and decentralized archiving.

##### Developing world

High latency networks are a real barrier of entry to developing world. IPFS provides resilient access to data, independent of low latency or connectivity to the backbone.

##### Blockchains

IPFS and the Blockchain are a perfect match! You can address large amounts of data with IPFS, and place the immutable, permanent IPFS links into a blockchain transaction. This timestamps and secures your content, without having to put the data on the chain itself.

##### Content creators

IPFS brings the freedom and independent spirit of the web at full force—and at low cost. IPFS can help deliver content in a way which can save you considerable money.
