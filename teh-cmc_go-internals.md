- **Concise**: The book aims to be as concise as possible, encouraging code and diagrams over lengthy prose.
- **Community-effort**: I myself am learning as I go through the writing of this book. I *will* make mistakes along the way. Hopefully the community can help in pointing out and correcting these mistakes.
- **Beyond the theory**: The book will not just cover the theory, but the actual implementation too. Assumptions will be proven or invalidated via experiments and measurements.
- **Up-to-Date**: The book will try to keep up-to-date with new Go versions being released.
- **Experienced audience**: The Go community has created *loads* of great introductory material for newcomers. Unfortunately we're still lacking good resources when it comes to the more advanced stuff. This books hopes to help solve this issue.
