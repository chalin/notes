Microsoft has built [some tree houses](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.microsoft.com%2Fjobs%2Fmeet-me-in-the-trees%2F%3FWT.tsrc%3DTwitter) for its employees. One sits in a Pacific Northwest Douglas fir, while another is 12 feet above the ground and features charred-wood walls and a high ceiling complete with a skylight. Microsoft describes it as having a “gingerbread-house” feel, which I’m guessing can only mean good things because it’s Christmas-y and Christmas is warm and fuzzy.

There are three tree houses in total: two are open, and the third is a sheltered lounge space, which is due to be completed later in the year. They feature meeting rooms which employees can use, or they can pop in and work away casually in other parts of the tree houses if they wish. They were created by Pete Nelson, who’s known for his building work on TV show [*Treehouse Masters*](https://www.nelsontreehouse.com/show/). The buildings will last at least 20 years and are made to expand as the trees grow, which is pretty wild.

The tree houses are a part of Microsoft’s “outdoor districts” which are connected to buildings around its Redmond campus. They feature weatherproof benches, hatches that hide electricity sockets, rustproof rocking chairs, a fireplace, wood canopies, and an outdoor Wi-Fi network. There are ramps built in for those who need them. If you get hungry, there’s also an indoor cafeteria that’s extended outside and a barbecue restaurant built into a shipping container.

Microsoft said it had been planning renovations and surveyed employees to see what they cared about the most. Employees said if they were given the opportunity, they would work outside more.

If you’re wondering what kind of effect nature’s workspace is having on Microsoft employees, here’s one passage describing an employee’s experience, according to a [blog post](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.microsoft.com%2Fjobs%2Fmeet-me-in-the-trees%2F%3FWT.tsrc%3DTwitter):

> “On a recent sunny day, an employee perched, legs crossed, on a soft grassy knoll below a treehouse. For several minutes, she sat with her hands on her knees, eyes closed, head tilted toward the sky, breathing deeply. Then she grabbed her laptop and typed furiously. After a spate of work, she set her computer aside, rested her palms on her knees, gazed up, and then closed her eyes again.”

I don’t really know what to make of that, but I’m happy for her. Here’s to nature!

Yeah, especially during the recent summer it would have been nice to work outside. The weather is turned pretty fast for the fall though. I saw hail this morning…

That guy’s TV persona is so goofball, it’s sometimes too much, have to turn it off. But at the same time, I kind of hope that’s how he is IRL. Neat treehouses in any case.

 [MikeZeitnerIsOn](https://www.theverge.com/users/MikeZeitnerIsOn)

I’ve met him and yes he’s corny but he’s also just about the nicest guy you’ll ever come across. It is not as "much" when in person because well it’s kind of contagious.

And I guess you want goofball mixed in with some sound engineering if you’re putting in a hugely expensive tree house. (most of the houses you see him create on the show start around $50K and just start climbing.

Yeah I definitely get the impression that those things are wildly expensive. The enthusiasm he shows for treehouses certainly comes off as authentic.

 [MrSteve007](https://www.theverge.com/users/MrSteve007)

Yup. Agreed. The Mrs. and I stayed at his Treehouse Point "hotel" a few years back and got to meet Pete in person. He really was that goofy and fun person, and it is infectious. A super nice guy who really does love trees and treehouses.

I’d love for him to build our family a treehouse someday.

Amazing and cool idea by Microsoft. Kudos to the facilities team.

But, that video is the worst. Taking a cool idea about creating more organic experiences, then showing it with staged corporate mannerisms is a huge miss. I’ll bet dollars to donuts that was the first time people shook hands to greet one another in a tree house. The video made it look like a typical corporate drone office with wood paneling.

But the video matters little, what is great is to see a large company thinking deeply about human needs and not falling into some beautiful but soul crushing corporate open-floor plan design. (It Saddens me to write, but this is what Apple did with their new HQ. Besutiful, but still with a soul and productivity crushing open floor plan.)
