A small glacial lake nestled in the world’s highest mountain range is the site of hundreds of unexplained deaths spanning more than 1,000 years, according to a new study.

Roopkund Lake, also known as “Skeleton Lake” because it is cluttered with human bones, has perplexed visitors for decades. Located over 16,400 feet above sea level in the Indian Himalayas, it was [rediscovered during the 1940s](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-skeleton-lake-of-roopkund-india-f-3-p-2-india) by a forest ranger. But the shallow lake was clearly known to ancient travelers, many of whom never made it out alive.

A small glacial lake nestled in the world’s highest mountain range is the site of hundreds of unexplained deaths spanning more than 1,000 years, according to a new study.

Roopkund Lake, also known as “Skeleton Lake” because it is cluttered with human bones, has perplexed visitors for decades. Located over 16,400 feet above sea level in the Indian Himalayas, it was [rediscovered during the 1940s](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-skeleton-lake-of-roopkund-india-f-3-p-2-india) by a forest ranger. But the shallow lake was clearly known to ancient travelers, many of whom never made it out alive.

Nobody knows what killed all these people at such a remote location. Until now, the leading theory was that [a brutal hailstorm](https://io9.gizmodo.com/why-is-lake-roopkund-full-of-skeletons-5954548) pummelled all of the travelers to death at the same time around 800 CE in a single catastrophic event, which might explain the unhealed compression fractures found on some of the bones. While deadly hail may account for some of the fatalities, new evidence strongly suggests that these people met their deaths in multiple different events at the lake across the centuries.

In [a study published on Tuesday](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11357-9) in * Nature Communications*, a team led by Éadaoin Harney, a PhD student in evolutionary biology at Harvard University, analyzed DNA extracted from 38 skeletons. This analysis revealed that many different populations experienced mortal incidents at the lake, including one that occurred as late as the 19th century.

“We find that the Roopkund skeletons belong to three genetically distinct groups that were deposited during multiple events, separated in time by approximately 1,000 years,” Harney’s team said in the study. “These findings refute previous suggestions that the skeletons of Roopkund Lake were deposited in a single catastrophic event.”

The earliest group of deceased travellers identified by the researchers, called Roopkund_A, contained 23 men and women from a diverse range of South Asian ancestries. This population was already known to have perished some 1,200 years ago, but radiocarbon dating showed that their deaths were likely not caused by a single violent storm as previously proposed.

Some of the Roopkund_A individuals were dated to earlier ranges of about 675-769 CE, while others were dated to between 894-985 CE. The gap in time suggests “that even these individuals may not have died simultaneously,” the team said.

Even more astonishing is the discovery of a second population, called Roopkund_B, which died just centuries ago, around 1800. This group contained 14 men and women of eastern Mediterranean descent, who were most genetically similar to the people of present-day Crete, the largest of the Greek islands. The third population is comprised of a sole individual, called Roopkund_C, who was a man of East Asian descent that died at the same time as the Roopkund_B group.

“Our study deepens the Roopkund mystery in many ways,” said study co-author Niraj Rai, head of the Ancient DNA Lab at Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences in India, in an email. At the same time, the team was able to rule out common “speculations about the ancestry of Roopkund individuals,” Rai said.

For instance, since the 1950s, there has [been a local theory](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/there-is-a-lake-full-of-skeletons-in-india-and-its-freaking-us-out-1356235-2018-10-05) that the skeletons were left by the fleeing army of general Zorawar Singh Kahluria, who was killed in an attempted invasion of Tibet in 1841. This explanation is challenged by the new discovery of several women at the site, who were unlikely to have been included in a military expedition.

The hailstorm theory is still plausible for some of the victims, and the team plans to examine the fractured skulls in their next study, Rai said.

Still, we don’t know how these groups ended up at such an inaccessible location in the first place. Roopkund Lake lies on the route of the Nanda Devi Raj Jat, a Hindu pilgrimage, which may have been observed as early as 1,200 years ago. For now, that is the most plausible explanation for the presence of at least some of the Roopkund_A individuals, the team said.

The remains of the other populations are much harder to explain. The study concludes that the Mediterranean individuals, who did not seem to have close familial ties to each other, were probably born under Ottoman rule.

“As suggested by their consumption of a predominantly terrestrial, rather than marine-based diet, they may have lived in an inland location, eventually traveling to and dying in the Himalayas,” the team said. “Whether they were participating in a pilgrimage, or were drawn to Roopkund Lake for other reasons, is a mystery.”

“Mystery” seems to be the operative word for anything to do with Roopkund Lake. While the site has become a destination for researchers and tourists—who have lived to tell the tale of their visits—the secrets of those who never left remain largely unknown.

The supermassive black hole that lives at the center of our galaxy has been mysteriously sparkling as of late, and nobody knows the reason.

This dark behemoth, known as as Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), is [four million times](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/multimedia/black-hole-SagittariusA.html) as massive as the Sun. Though no light escapes its boundaries, astronomers can observe the hole’s interactions with bright stars or dust clouds that surround it.

On the night of May 13, 2019, UCLA astronomer Tuan Do and his colleagues were watching Sgr A* using the Keck Telescope on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawai’i. In a period of just two hours, they witnessed the black hole [become 75 times brighter](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2213058-milky-ways-black-hole-has-got-75-times-brighter-and-we-dont-know-why/) in the near-infrared band of the light spectrum.

That spring evening, the Milky Way’s supermassive black hole “reached much brighter flux levels in 2019 than ever measured at near-infrared wavelengths,” according to [a forthcoming study](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01777)*, *led by Do and published on the arXiv preprint server.

“The brightness of Sgr A* varies all the time, getting brighter and fainter on the timescale of minutes to hours—it basically flickers like a candle,” Do said in an email. “We think that something unusual might be happening this year because the black hole seems to vary in brightness more, reaching brighter levels than we've ever seen in the past.”

The peak flux, meaning the most luminous phase of the flare-up, soared to “twice the maximum historical flux measurements,” Do’s team said in the study. In other words, in the 20 years since astronomers have monitored Sgr A*, the next-brightest event has only been half as dazzling as this one.

This unusual sparkle at the galactic core was likely caused by close encounters between Sgr A* and objects surrounding it, according to the team.

The edge of a black hole, called an event horizon, is shaped by intense tidal forces that tear at anything that gets close. Once a black hole starts devouring nearby objects like stars or gas clouds, infalling material heats up at the event horizon, sparking light shows that can be picked up by telescopes.

Do and his colleagues speculate that a star called S0-2, which is about 15 times as massive as the Sun, may have been the object that juiced Sgr A*. In 2018, S0-2 came [within 17 light hours](https://www.sciencealert.com/our-galaxy-s-supermassive-black-hole-just-mysteriously-got-really-really-bright) of the supermassive black hole, and that close pass may have disturbed gases at the event horizon enough to cause the May 2019 brightening event.

Another possible culprit is a dust cloud known as G2, which passed about [36 light hours from Sgr A*](https://aasnova.org/2017/07/24/the-story-of-a-boring-encounter-with-a-black-hole/) in 2014. Scientists predicted that G2 would be torn apart by the hole, but the results were ultimately described as [disappointing and “boring”](https://aasnova.org/2017/07/24/the-story-of-a-boring-encounter-with-a-black-hole/) for astronomers.

That initial letdown may have been premature, though, because we might be seeing the slow-burn “delayed reaction” to the gas cloud’s approach, the team said.

“Many astronomers are observing Sgr A* this summer,” Do noted. “I'm hoping we can get as much data as we can this year before the region of the sky with Sgr A* gets behind the Sun and we won't be able to observe it again until next year.”

“Maybe the black hole is waking up—there's a lot we don't know at this point so we need more data to understand if what we are seeing is a big change in what is feeding the black hole or this is a brief event,” he said.

In the middle of the day on Monday, the sky above São Paulo, Brazil went dark.

The city, along with parts of the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Paraná, was blanketed by smoke from wildfires raging in the Amazon, according to [local news reports](https://g1.globo.com/sp/sao-paulo/noticia/2019/08/19/dia-vira-noite-em-sao-paulo-com-chegada-de-frente-fria-nesta-segunda.ghtml).

Earlier this month, Amazonas (the largest state in Brazil) declared a [state of emergency](https://www.euronews.com/2019/08/11/brazil-state-of-amazonas-declares-state-of-emergency-over-rising-number-of-forest-fires) over the rising number of forest fires, reported Euro News. Fire season in the Amazon is just beginning—it runs from August through October, with its peak coming in mid-September, and the smoke is already so bad that it can be seen from space

Last week, NASA released [satellite images](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145464/fires-in-brazil) showing the patchwork of fires and smoke in Brazil. Citing the [Global Fire Emissions Database](https://www.globalfiredata.org/updates.html#), NASA noted that though current fire levels are slightly below average compared to the last 15 years, they are higher in some states, such as Amazonas and Rondônia.

“The state of Amazonas, in particular, has seen well above average daily fire activity through August so far,” said Mark Parrington, a [senior scientist working on wildfire emissions](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/who-we-are/staff-profiles/mark-parrington) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.

According to Parrington, fires in the Amazon release an average of 500-600 megatonnes of carbon dioxide over the course of a typical year. In 2019 so far, they’ve already released 200 megatonnes of the greenhouse gas. According to the Global Fire Emissions Database, 8,668 fires have been detected in Amazonas as of Monday. That exceeds the past few years, and falls just short of the 2016 high of 8,836.

[Satellite](https://mobile.twitter.com/noaasatellites/status/1161360217671532544) imagery has [tracked the movement of the smoke,](https://www.windy.com/pt/-Concentra%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-CO-cosc?cosc,-18.958,-53.921,5) which completely [filled](https://twitter.com/jnascim/status/1163527563383382017) the [air](https://twitter.com/Toberal_Fox/status/1163558051523244032) in São Paulo. Gustavo Faleiros, an editor at the environmental news group InfoAmazonia, said in an email that the air quality was even worse in the countryside than in the city.

“Countryside residents started complaining about the wildfire smoke, because the air used to be clean there and now the city is full of smoke and ashes,” Alberto Shiguematsu, a São Paulo resident who tweeted about the smoke, said.

According to Shiguematsu, the sky went “really dark” around 3:15 PM yesterday. He said that in his ten years of living in São Paulo, he’s never seen wildfire smoke like that. He’d read that there were fires in the Amazon, but didn’t think he’d be affected.

“The smoke coming here, in São Paulo, thousands of kilometers away? That hit me by surprise,” he said.

The news of these fires comes amidst reports of increased deforestation under far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, which has prompted [protests at home](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-49329680) and [international](https://news.mongabay.com/2019/08/germany-cuts-39-5-million-in-environmental-funding-to-brazil/)  [concern](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/16/norway-halts-amazon-fund-donation-dispute-brazil-deforestation-jair-bolsonaro). While the smoke from the fires threatens the health of those living nearby, more fires represent an added stressor for the Amazon rainforest as a whole.

The humidity of the Amazon has, [in the past,](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/fires-could-turn-amazon-rainforest-into-a-desert-as-human-activity-and-climate-change-threaten-lungs-9259741.html) protected it against massive fires, but drought, deforestation, and agriculture could make fires so common that they would completely alter the landscape, a [2014 study warned](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/17/6347). According to a [blog post](https://infoamazonia.org/pt/2019/08/portugues-satelites-da-nasa-mostram-alta-de-queimadas-junto-ao-desmatamento/#!/story=post-20082) for InfoAmazonia, Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research predicts that rainfall in the central and northern Amazon will be 40 to 50 percent below normal in the next three months.

“There is a direct relationship between increased burning and the growth of deforestation,” Faleiros wrote in the [blog post](https://infoamazonia.org/pt/2019/08/portugues-satelites-da-nasa-mostram-alta-de-queimadas-junto-ao-desmatamento/#!/story=post-20082). “Among the 10 municipalities that recorded the largest burnings in 2019, seven are also on the list of municipalities with the highest number of deforestation warnings.”

***Correction: ****An earlier version of this article measured the CO2 emissions of Amazon fires in terms of metric tons instead of the correct megatonnes. Motherboard regrets the error. *

Last week, NASA released [satellite images](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145464/fires-in-brazil) showing the patchwork of fires and smoke in Brazil. Citing the [Global Fire Emissions Database](https://www.globalfiredata.org/updates.html#), NASA noted that though current fire levels are slightly below average compared to the last 15 years, they are higher in some states, such as Amazonas and Rondônia.

“The state of Amazonas, in particular, has seen well above average daily fire activity through August so far,” said Mark Parrington, a [senior scientist working on wildfire emissions](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/who-we-are/staff-profiles/mark-parrington) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.

According to Parrington, fires in the Amazon release an average of 500-600 megatonnes of carbon dioxide over the course of a typical year. In 2019 so far, they’ve already released 200 megatonnes of the greenhouse gas. According to the Global Fire Emissions Database, 8,668 fires have been detected in Amazonas as of Monday. That exceeds the past few years, and falls just short of the 2016 high of 8,836.

[Satellite](https://mobile.twitter.com/noaasatellites/status/1161360217671532544) imagery has [tracked the movement of the smoke,](https://www.windy.com/pt/-Concentra%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-CO-cosc?cosc,-18.958,-53.921,5) which completely [filled](https://twitter.com/jnascim/status/1163527563383382017) the [air](https://twitter.com/Toberal_Fox/status/1163558051523244032) in São Paulo. Gustavo Faleiros, an editor at the environmental news group InfoAmazonia, said in an email that the air quality was even worse in the countryside than in the city.

“Countryside residents started complaining about the wildfire smoke, because the air used to be clean there and now the city is full of smoke and ashes,” Alberto Shiguematsu, a São Paulo resident who tweeted about the smoke, said.

According to Shiguematsu, the sky went “really dark” around 3:15 PM yesterday. He said that in his ten years of living in São Paulo, he’s never seen wildfire smoke like that. He’d read that there were fires in the Amazon, but didn’t think he’d be affected.

“The smoke coming here, in São Paulo, thousands of kilometers away? That hit me by surprise,” he said.

The news of these fires comes amidst reports of increased deforestation under far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, which has prompted [protests at home](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-49329680) and [international](https://news.mongabay.com/2019/08/germany-cuts-39-5-million-in-environmental-funding-to-brazil/)  [concern](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/16/norway-halts-amazon-fund-donation-dispute-brazil-deforestation-jair-bolsonaro). While the smoke from the fires threatens the health of those living nearby, more fires represent an added stressor for the Amazon rainforest as a whole.

The humidity of the Amazon has, [in the past,](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/fires-could-turn-amazon-rainforest-into-a-desert-as-human-activity-and-climate-change-threaten-lungs-9259741.html) protected it against massive fires, but drought, deforestation, and agriculture could make fires so common that they would completely alter the landscape, a [2014 study warned](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/17/6347). According to a [blog post](https://infoamazonia.org/pt/2019/08/portugues-satelites-da-nasa-mostram-alta-de-queimadas-junto-ao-desmatamento/#!/story=post-20082) for InfoAmazonia, Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research predicts that rainfall in the central and northern Amazon will be 40 to 50 percent below normal in the next three months.

“There is a direct relationship between increased burning and the growth of deforestation,” Faleiros wrote in the [blog post](https://infoamazonia.org/pt/2019/08/portugues-satelites-da-nasa-mostram-alta-de-queimadas-junto-ao-desmatamento/#!/story=post-20082). “Among the 10 municipalities that recorded the largest burnings in 2019, seven are also on the list of municipalities with the highest number of deforestation warnings.”

***Correction: ****An earlier version of this article measured the CO2 emissions of Amazon fires in terms of metric tons instead of the correct megatonnes. Motherboard regrets the error. *

A small glacial lake nestled in the world’s highest mountain range is the site of hundreds of unexplained deaths spanning more than 1,000 years, according to a new study.

Roopkund Lake, also known as “Skeleton Lake” because it is cluttered with human bones, has perplexed visitors for decades. Located over 16,400 feet above sea level in the Indian Himalayas, it was [rediscovered during the 1940s](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-skeleton-lake-of-roopkund-india-f-3-p-2-india) by a forest ranger. But the shallow lake was clearly known to ancient travelers, many of whom never made it out alive.

Nobody knows what killed all these people at such a remote location. Until now, the leading theory was that [a brutal hailstorm](https://io9.gizmodo.com/why-is-lake-roopkund-full-of-skeletons-5954548) pummelled all of the travelers to death at the same time around 800 CE in a single catastrophic event, which might explain the unhealed compression fractures found on some of the bones. While deadly hail may account for some of the fatalities, new evidence strongly suggests that these people met their deaths in multiple different events at the lake across the centuries.

In [a study published on Tuesday](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11357-9) in * Nature Communications*, a team led by Éadaoin Harney, a PhD student in evolutionary biology at Harvard University, analyzed DNA extracted from 38 skeletons. This analysis revealed that many different populations experienced mortal incidents at the lake, including one that occurred as late as the 19th century.

“We find that the Roopkund skeletons belong to three genetically distinct groups that were deposited during multiple events, separated in time by approximately 1,000 years,” Harney’s team said in the study. “These findings refute previous suggestions that the skeletons of Roopkund Lake were deposited in a single catastrophic event.”

The earliest group of deceased travellers identified by the researchers, called Roopkund_A, contained 23 men and women from a diverse range of South Asian ancestries. This population was already known to have perished some 1,200 years ago, but radiocarbon dating showed that their deaths were likely not caused by a single violent storm as previously proposed.

Some of the Roopkund_A individuals were dated to earlier ranges of about 675-769 CE, while others were dated to between 894-985 CE. The gap in time suggests “that even these individuals may not have died simultaneously,” the team said.

Even more astonishing is the discovery of a second population, called Roopkund_B, which died just centuries ago, around 1800. This group contained 14 men and women of eastern Mediterranean descent, who were most genetically similar to the people of present-day Crete, the largest of the Greek islands. The third population is comprised of a sole individual, called Roopkund_C, who was a man of East Asian descent that died at the same time as the Roopkund_B group.

“Our study deepens the Roopkund mystery in many ways,” said study co-author Niraj Rai, head of the Ancient DNA Lab at Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences in India, in an email. At the same time, the team was able to rule out common “speculations about the ancestry of Roopkund individuals,” Rai said.

For instance, since the 1950s, there has [been a local theory](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/there-is-a-lake-full-of-skeletons-in-india-and-its-freaking-us-out-1356235-2018-10-05) that the skeletons were left by the fleeing army of general Zorawar Singh Kahluria, who was killed in an attempted invasion of Tibet in 1841. This explanation is challenged by the new discovery of several women at the site, who were unlikely to have been included in a military expedition.

The hailstorm theory is still plausible for some of the victims, and the team plans to examine the fractured skulls in their next study, Rai said.

Still, we don’t know how these groups ended up at such an inaccessible location in the first place. Roopkund Lake lies on the route of the Nanda Devi Raj Jat, a Hindu pilgrimage, which may have been observed as early as 1,200 years ago. For now, that is the most plausible explanation for the presence of at least some of the Roopkund_A individuals, the team said.

The remains of the other populations are much harder to explain. The study concludes that the Mediterranean individuals, who did not seem to have close familial ties to each other, were probably born under Ottoman rule.

“As suggested by their consumption of a predominantly terrestrial, rather than marine-based diet, they may have lived in an inland location, eventually traveling to and dying in the Himalayas,” the team said. “Whether they were participating in a pilgrimage, or were drawn to Roopkund Lake for other reasons, is a mystery.”

“Mystery” seems to be the operative word for anything to do with Roopkund Lake. While the site has become a destination for researchers and tourists—who have lived to tell the tale of their visits—the secrets of those who never left remain largely unknown.

The supermassive black hole that lives at the center of our galaxy has been mysteriously sparkling as of late, and nobody knows the reason.

This dark behemoth, known as as Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), is [four million times](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/multimedia/black-hole-SagittariusA.html) as massive as the Sun. Though no light escapes its boundaries, astronomers can observe the hole’s interactions with bright stars or dust clouds that surround it.

On the night of May 13, 2019, UCLA astronomer Tuan Do and his colleagues were watching Sgr A* using the Keck Telescope on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawai’i. In a period of just two hours, they witnessed the black hole [become 75 times brighter](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2213058-milky-ways-black-hole-has-got-75-times-brighter-and-we-dont-know-why/) in the near-infrared band of the light spectrum.

That spring evening, the Milky Way’s supermassive black hole “reached much brighter flux levels in 2019 than ever measured at near-infrared wavelengths,” according to [a forthcoming study](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01777)*, *led by Do and published on the arXiv preprint server.

“The brightness of Sgr A* varies all the time, getting brighter and fainter on the timescale of minutes to hours—it basically flickers like a candle,” Do said in an email. “We think that something unusual might be happening this year because the black hole seems to vary in brightness more, reaching brighter levels than we've ever seen in the past.”

The peak flux, meaning the most luminous phase of the flare-up, soared to “twice the maximum historical flux measurements,” Do’s team said in the study. In other words, in the 20 years since astronomers have monitored Sgr A*, the next-brightest event has only been half as dazzling as this one.

This unusual sparkle at the galactic core was likely caused by close encounters between Sgr A* and objects surrounding it, according to the team.

The edge of a black hole, called an event horizon, is shaped by intense tidal forces that tear at anything that gets close. Once a black hole starts devouring nearby objects like stars or gas clouds, infalling material heats up at the event horizon, sparking light shows that can be picked up by telescopes.

Do and his colleagues speculate that a star called S0-2, which is about 15 times as massive as the Sun, may have been the object that juiced Sgr A*. In 2018, S0-2 came [within 17 light hours](https://www.sciencealert.com/our-galaxy-s-supermassive-black-hole-just-mysteriously-got-really-really-bright) of the supermassive black hole, and that close pass may have disturbed gases at the event horizon enough to cause the May 2019 brightening event.

Another possible culprit is a dust cloud known as G2, which passed about [36 light hours from Sgr A*](https://aasnova.org/2017/07/24/the-story-of-a-boring-encounter-with-a-black-hole/) in 2014. Scientists predicted that G2 would be torn apart by the hole, but the results were ultimately described as [disappointing and “boring”](https://aasnova.org/2017/07/24/the-story-of-a-boring-encounter-with-a-black-hole/) for astronomers.

That initial letdown may have been premature, though, because we might be seeing the slow-burn “delayed reaction” to the gas cloud’s approach, the team said.

“Many astronomers are observing Sgr A* this summer,” Do noted. “I'm hoping we can get as much data as we can this year before the region of the sky with Sgr A* gets behind the Sun and we won't be able to observe it again until next year.”

“Maybe the black hole is waking up—there's a lot we don't know at this point so we need more data to understand if what we are seeing is a big change in what is feeding the black hole or this is a brief event,” he said.

In the middle of the day on Monday, the sky above São Paulo, Brazil went dark.

The city, along with parts of the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Paraná, was blanketed by smoke from wildfires raging in the Amazon, according to [local news reports](https://g1.globo.com/sp/sao-paulo/noticia/2019/08/19/dia-vira-noite-em-sao-paulo-com-chegada-de-frente-fria-nesta-segunda.ghtml).

Earlier this month, Amazonas (the largest state in Brazil) declared a [state of emergency](https://www.euronews.com/2019/08/11/brazil-state-of-amazonas-declares-state-of-emergency-over-rising-number-of-forest-fires) over the rising number of forest fires, reported Euro News. Fire season in the Amazon is just beginning—it runs from August through October, with its peak coming in mid-September, and the smoke is already so bad that it can be seen from space

Last week, NASA released [satellite images](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145464/fires-in-brazil) showing the patchwork of fires and smoke in Brazil. Citing the [Global Fire Emissions Database](https://www.globalfiredata.org/updates.html#), NASA noted that though current fire levels are slightly below average compared to the last 15 years, they are higher in some states, such as Amazonas and Rondônia.

“The state of Amazonas, in particular, has seen well above average daily fire activity through August so far,” said Mark Parrington, a [senior scientist working on wildfire emissions](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/who-we-are/staff-profiles/mark-parrington) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.

According to Parrington, fires in the Amazon release an average of 500-600 megatonnes of carbon dioxide over the course of a typical year. In 2019 so far, they’ve already released 200 megatonnes of the greenhouse gas. According to the Global Fire Emissions Database, 8,668 fires have been detected in Amazonas as of Monday. That exceeds the past few years, and falls just short of the 2016 high of 8,836.

[Satellite](https://mobile.twitter.com/noaasatellites/status/1161360217671532544) imagery has [tracked the movement of the smoke,](https://www.windy.com/pt/-Concentra%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-CO-cosc?cosc,-18.958,-53.921,5) which completely [filled](https://twitter.com/jnascim/status/1163527563383382017) the [air](https://twitter.com/Toberal_Fox/status/1163558051523244032) in São Paulo. Gustavo Faleiros, an editor at the environmental news group InfoAmazonia, said in an email that the air quality was even worse in the countryside than in the city.

“Countryside residents started complaining about the wildfire smoke, because the air used to be clean there and now the city is full of smoke and ashes,” Alberto Shiguematsu, a São Paulo resident who tweeted about the smoke, said.

According to Shiguematsu, the sky went “really dark” around 3:15 PM yesterday. He said that in his ten years of living in São Paulo, he’s never seen wildfire smoke like that. He’d read that there were fires in the Amazon, but didn’t think he’d be affected.

“The smoke coming here, in São Paulo, thousands of kilometers away? That hit me by surprise,” he said.

The news of these fires comes amidst reports of increased deforestation under far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, which has prompted [protests at home](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-49329680) and [international](https://news.mongabay.com/2019/08/germany-cuts-39-5-million-in-environmental-funding-to-brazil/)  [concern](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/16/norway-halts-amazon-fund-donation-dispute-brazil-deforestation-jair-bolsonaro). While the smoke from the fires threatens the health of those living nearby, more fires represent an added stressor for the Amazon rainforest as a whole.

The humidity of the Amazon has, [in the past,](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/fires-could-turn-amazon-rainforest-into-a-desert-as-human-activity-and-climate-change-threaten-lungs-9259741.html) protected it against massive fires, but drought, deforestation, and agriculture could make fires so common that they would completely alter the landscape, a [2014 study warned](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/17/6347). According to a [blog post](https://infoamazonia.org/pt/2019/08/portugues-satelites-da-nasa-mostram-alta-de-queimadas-junto-ao-desmatamento/#!/story=post-20082) for InfoAmazonia, Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research predicts that rainfall in the central and northern Amazon will be 40 to 50 percent below normal in the next three months.

“There is a direct relationship between increased burning and the growth of deforestation,” Faleiros wrote in the [blog post](https://infoamazonia.org/pt/2019/08/portugues-satelites-da-nasa-mostram-alta-de-queimadas-junto-ao-desmatamento/#!/story=post-20082). “Among the 10 municipalities that recorded the largest burnings in 2019, seven are also on the list of municipalities with the highest number of deforestation warnings.”

In the middle of the day on Monday, the sky above São Paulo, Brazil went dark.

The city, along with parts of the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Paraná, was blanketed by smoke from wildfires raging in the Amazon, according to [local news reports](https://g1.globo.com/sp/sao-paulo/noticia/2019/08/19/dia-vira-noite-em-sao-paulo-com-chegada-de-frente-fria-nesta-segunda.ghtml).

Earlier this month, Amazonas (the largest state in Brazil) declared a [state of emergency](https://www.euronews.com/2019/08/11/brazil-state-of-amazonas-declares-state-of-emergency-over-rising-number-of-forest-fires) over the rising number of forest fires, reported Euro News. Fire season in the Amazon is just beginning—it runs from August through October, with its peak coming in mid-September, and the smoke is already so bad that it can be seen from space

Last week, NASA released [satellite images](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145464/fires-in-brazil) showing the patchwork of fires and smoke in Brazil. Citing the [Global Fire Emissions Database](https://www.globalfiredata.org/updates.html#), NASA noted that though current fire levels are slightly below average compared to the last 15 years, they are higher in some states, such as Amazonas and Rondônia.

“The state of Amazonas, in particular, has seen well above average daily fire activity through August so far,” said Mark Parrington, a [senior scientist working on wildfire emissions](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/who-we-are/staff-profiles/mark-parrington) at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.

According to Parrington, fires in the Amazon release an average of 500-600 megatonnes of carbon dioxide over the course of a typical year. In 2019 so far, they’ve already released 200 megatonnes of the greenhouse gas. According to the Global Fire Emissions Database, 8,668 fires have been detected in Amazonas as of Monday. That exceeds the past few years, and falls just short of the 2016 high of 8,836.

Nobody knows what killed all these people at such a remote location. Until now, the leading theory was that [a brutal hailstorm](https://io9.gizmodo.com/why-is-lake-roopkund-full-of-skeletons-5954548) pummelled all of the travelers to death at the same time around 800 CE in a single catastrophic event, which might explain the unhealed compression fractures found on some of the bones. While deadly hail may account for some of the fatalities, new evidence strongly suggests that these people met their deaths in multiple different events at the lake across the centuries.

In [a study published on Tuesday](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11357-9) in * Nature Communications*, a team led by Éadaoin Harney, a PhD student in evolutionary biology at Harvard University, analyzed DNA extracted from 38 skeletons. This analysis revealed that many different populations experienced mortal incidents at the lake, including one that occurred as late as the 19th century.

“We find that the Roopkund skeletons belong to three genetically distinct groups that were deposited during multiple events, separated in time by approximately 1,000 years,” Harney’s team said in the study. “These findings refute previous suggestions that the skeletons of Roopkund Lake were deposited in a single catastrophic event.”

The earliest group of deceased travellers identified by the researchers, called Roopkund_A, contained 23 men and women from a diverse range of South Asian ancestries. This population was already known to have perished some 1,200 years ago, but radiocarbon dating showed that their deaths were likely not caused by a single violent storm as previously proposed.

Some of the Roopkund_A individuals were dated to earlier ranges of about 675-769 CE, while others were dated to between 894-985 CE. The gap in time suggests “that even these individuals may not have died simultaneously,” the team said.

Even more astonishing is the discovery of a second population, called Roopkund_B, which died just centuries ago, around 1800. This group contained 14 men and women of eastern Mediterranean descent, who were most genetically similar to the people of present-day Crete, the largest of the Greek islands. The third population is comprised of a sole individual, called Roopkund_C, who was a man of East Asian descent that died at the same time as the Roopkund_B group.

“Our study deepens the Roopkund mystery in many ways,” said study co-author Niraj Rai, head of the Ancient DNA Lab at Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences in India, in an email. At the same time, the team was able to rule out common “speculations about the ancestry of Roopkund individuals,” Rai said.

For instance, since the 1950s, there has [been a local theory](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/there-is-a-lake-full-of-skeletons-in-india-and-its-freaking-us-out-1356235-2018-10-05) that the skeletons were left by the fleeing army of general Zorawar Singh Kahluria, who was killed in an attempted invasion of Tibet in 1841. This explanation is challenged by the new discovery of several women at the site, who were unlikely to have been included in a military expedition.

The hailstorm theory is still plausible for some of the victims, and the team plans to examine the fractured skulls in their next study, Rai said.

Still, we don’t know how these groups ended up at such an inaccessible location in the first place. Roopkund Lake lies on the route of the Nanda Devi Raj Jat, a Hindu pilgrimage, which may have been observed as early as 1,200 years ago. For now, that is the most plausible explanation for the presence of at least some of the Roopkund_A individuals, the team said.

The remains of the other populations are much harder to explain. The study concludes that the Mediterranean individuals, who did not seem to have close familial ties to each other, were probably born under Ottoman rule.

“As suggested by their consumption of a predominantly terrestrial, rather than marine-based diet, they may have lived in an inland location, eventually traveling to and dying in the Himalayas,” the team said. “Whether they were participating in a pilgrimage, or were drawn to Roopkund Lake for other reasons, is a mystery.”

“Mystery” seems to be the operative word for anything to do with Roopkund Lake. While the site has become a destination for researchers and tourists—who have lived to tell the tale of their visits—the secrets of those who never left remain largely unknown.
