## Integrated teams working together

GitLab is the first single application built from the ground up for all stages of the DevOps lifecycle for Product, Development, QA, Security, and Operations teams to work concurrently on the same project. GitLab enables teams to collaborate and work from a single conversation, instead of managing multiple threads across disparate tools. GitLab provides teams a single data store, one user interface, and one permission model across the DevOps lifecycle allowing teams to collaborate, significantly reducing cycle time and focus exclusively on building great software quickly.

## GitLab + Google Cloud Platform = simplified, scalable deployment

GitLab’s native Google Kubernetes Engine integration increases developer productivity. With Auto DevOps, GitLab automatically configures CI/CD pipelines to build, test, verify, and deploy applications to Google Cloud Platform.

## Work Concurrently, No More Handoffs

 ![](../_resources/a4393039164a4d989e1fae387a9a674c.png)

Dev, QA, Security and Operations are part of a single conversation throughout the lifecycle. Detect problems earlier by ‘shifting them to the left’ and solving them with out delays.

Teams work at the same time instead of waiting for Security, QA, and Operations handoffs because teams are backlogged.
