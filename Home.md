# RioRun Interactive Podcast

For the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the [Guardian US' interactive team](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/guardian-us-interactive-team) built an [interactive podcast app](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/06/rio-running-app-marathon-course-riorun) that takes you along a virtual audio tour of the marathon route. The app uses your phone to track your distance — what you hear will depend on how far you run (or walk!) and how fast. As you go, you'll unlock new audio segments at key moments along the route. I was responsible for the design of RioRun, which included the logo, app interface, badges icons, and social share images. Read about how we built it [here](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/how-guardian-made-riorun/). And take the tour yourself [here](http://riorun.theguardian.com/) (phone only).

# Gun Violence Mapping

I worked alongside reporters [Lois Beckett](https://twitter.com/loisbeckett) and [Jamiles Lartley](https://twitter.com/JamilesLartey) and interactive editor [Aliza Aufritig](https://twitter.com/alizauf) at the [Guardian US](https://www.theguardian.com/us) to publish a first-of-its-kind geographic analysis of national gun homicides mapped down to the census tract level. I lead the design and built all of the static maps. The project was presented in two parts:

["Want to fix gun violence in America? Go local."](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/jan/09/special-report-fixing-gun-violence-in-america)

["Grasping for change on America's most violent streets: 'We must stop killing'"](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2017/jan/10/st-louis-gun-crime-missouri-natural-bridge-avenue)

# Lead Illustrations

The first set of illustrations (four total) was designed for the [Guardian US'](https://www.theguardian.com/us) DIY abortion in American series. I wanted to capture modern women in Victorian silhouettes, a form that I felt preserved anonymity, while providing a sense of dignity to each figure. The silhouettes were hand hand cut and deconstructed to echo the reporting themes and then photographed.

• ["‘Please, I am out of options’: inside the murky world of DIY abortions"](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/21/home-abortions-emails-secret-world)

• ["Jailed for ending a pregnancy: how prosecutors get inventive on abortion"](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/22/abortion-pregnancy-law-prosecute-trump)

• ["Abortion rights are already under siege – and it's only going to get worse"](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2016/nov/22/abortion-rights-under-siege-roe-v-wade-womens-rights)

• Unpublished silhouette

The second set of illustrations (three total) was designed for the [Guardian US'](https://www.theguardian.com/us) continuing Homan Square coverage that details allegations of abuse inside a secretive facility operated by the Chicago police department. The complex layering was chosen to illustrate the dark, intricate system designed to disappear and hide detainees at the facility.

• ["'I was struck with multiple blows': inside the secret violence of Homan Square](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/11/homan-square-chicago-police-internal-documents-physical-force-prisoner-abuse)"

• ["A death in police custody: what really happened at Chicago's Homan Square?"](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/12/homan-square-chicago-police-files-custody-death-jaime-galvan)

• ["The hidden: how Chicago police kept thousands isolated at Homan Square"](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/13/homan-square-chicago-police-records-secret-interrogation-facility-new-documents-lawsuit)

This checkered mosaic of women was designed to lead CNN's ["They're not celebrities. Their voice coach isn't either. But #MeToo changed their lives."](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/08/us/metoo-voice-coach-peter-rofe/index.html) I chose to focus the portrait (built out of many portraits) on the mouth. It represents both the voice actors' profession and their voice in the #MeToo movement.

The "infinity needle" illustration was designed to lead Jason Cherkis' Putlizer-Prize-finalist and Ellie-nominated ["Dying To Be Free: There’s A Treatment For Heroin Addiction That Actually Works.Why Aren’t We Using It?"](http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/dying-to-be-free-heroin-treatment?utm_source=scoopinion) for [The Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/). The design symbolizes the cyclical fight against addiction.

The final illustration is unpublished, but was originally designed for [The Huffington Post's](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/) ongoing investigation of [No Limit rapper McKinley Mac Phipps'](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/mckinley-mac-phipps/) manslaughter conviction.

# UConn Win Streak

The prep for the 2017 NCCA Women's Basketball Final Four, I wrote, designed, and coded a data driven piece for the Guardian US on the University of Connecticut women's basketball team's historic 111-game win streak. The Huskies lost in the semi-final round, ending the streak that spanned three seasons. See it live [here](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2017/mar/29/uconn-womens-basketball-ncaa-most-dominant-team-in-sports-interactive).

# Animated SVG Polygon Cats

During the spring of 2015, I completed [General Assembly's Front-End Web Development](https://generalassemb.ly/education/front-end-web-development) course. These animated SVG polygon cats, featuring my fur baby Rorschach (the first one), were built for my final project. The polygons were crafted in Illustrator, exported as SVG, and animated with [GreenSock Animation Platform's](https://greensock.com/gsap) TimelineMax.

The animations can be found [here](http://jadiehm.github.io/).

# Census API Mapping

I built this Census mapper app for my final project while taking [General Assembly's Javascript Development](https://generalassemb.ly/education/learn-javascript-online#information-modal) course. It pulls in data from the [Census' American Community Survey API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/ACS-supplemental-data.html) and maps it to the county level using D3. The maps can be toggled between choropleth and proportional bubbles and there is a dropdown menu to select different demographics.

# Election 2016

For the 2016 presidential election, the [Guardian US](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/guardian-us-interactive-team) interactive team ([Aliza Aufritig](https://twitter.com/alizauf), [Kenan Davis](https://twitter.com/kenandavis), [Rich Harris](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris), [Nadja Popovich](https://twitter.com/PopovichN), and [myself](https://twitter.com/jadiehm)) designed and developed an election dashboard to track results for the presidential, senate and house races. The app featured live results in map and table form, notifications, demographic details and the signature 8-bit trash-talking candidates created by Nadja.

# Line Work

This is a collection of line art that I have drawn in Illustrator.

The first set of portraits was designed to show all of Donald Trump's ridiculous connections, from Sarah Palin to Oprah Winfrey and Chris Christie to Kid Rock, in the [Guardian US'](https://www.theguardian.com/us)  ["Entering the orbit of a 'total narcissist': who's who in Donald Trump's inner circle."](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/15/donald-trump-friends-family-staff-inner-circle-whos-who)

The illustrations about naloxone doses were drawn for the [Guardian US'](https://www.theguardian.com/us) piece ["How price-gouging of opioid overdose cure costs lives: 'There's never enough'."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/16/opioid-overdose-naloxone-pharmaceutical-price-gouging)

The [animated illustrations](http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/super-bowl-50-dab-carolina-panthers-quarterback-cam/story?id=36738583) of Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton doing his signature touchdown celebration were designed for [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/) for their 2016 Super Bowl coverage.

The set of [instructional party game cards](https://www.visualnews.com/2015/05/28/how-to-play-party-games-from-around-the-world/) were designed for content marketing agency [Column Five's](https://www.columnfivemedia.com/)  [Visual News](https://www.visualnews.com/) site.

And the last scientific diagram was designed for the [Huffington Post's](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/) piece ["This Is How Much Of Beyoncé’s Breath You Inhale Every Time You Breathe."](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/12/beyonce-breath_n_6290956.html)

# Interactive Trump Magnetic Hair Game

After completing [General Assembly's Front-End Web Development](https://generalassemb.ly/education/front-end-web-development) course in the spring of 2015, I wanted to put my new skills to use for something politics-related. I ended up with this interactive magnetic hair game that's just as outlandish as "The Donald" himself. It's modeled after the vintage [Wooly Willy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooly_Willy) toy.

Play around with it [here](http://jadiehm.github.io/TrumpHair.html).

# Black Sitcoms Data Reporting

One of the most comprehensive data reporting projects I worked on while at T[he Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/) was part of ["How To Make It As A Black Sitcom: Be Careful How You Talk About Race,"](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/21/black-sitcom-black-ish_n_6002850.html) a piece that looked at the history of black sitcoms just as ABC's ["Black-ish"](http://abc.go.com/shows/blackish) was about to premiere. I gathered all the data, performed the analysis and built the static and interactive charts for this feature.

The [interactive arc chart](http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BlackSitcoms10172014_D.html) was built (before I learned more efficient ways to do it!) in Illustrator and each arc was hand coded.

# Disney Princesses & Baby Names Data Reporting

While at [The Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/) I looked into the popularity of Disney princess names. Inspired by the [Harvard Sports Analysis Collective's](http://harvardsportsanalysis.org/) "[Shaq Attack: The Rise of Babies Names Shaquille](https://harvardsportsanalysis.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/shaq-attackthe-rise-of-the-baby-name-shaquille/)," I mined [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/) data and found that quite a few princess names gained popularity in the years after a movie featuring a princess character was released.

See the original post [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/14/disney-princess-names_n_5318241.html).

# Photography

While studying journalism at [Western Kentucky University](https://www.wku.edu/journalism/) I focused on photography and design. Here are some shots on my Canon 5D Mark II over the years. I'm very interested in exploring data driven work through photography like [Nicholas Felton's](https://twitter.com/feltron?lang=en)  [PhotoViz](http://feltron.com/PhotoViz.html) and photo layering like [Daniella Zalcman's](https://twitter.com/dzalcman) [echosight](http://echosight.me/) project.

# Promotional Work

These are designs done both professionally and personally for promotional purposes.

The first image is a poster adaptation of illustrations done for the Huffington Post's ["Things All Movie Musicals Need To Succeed."](http://visual.ly/movie-musicals-these-are-few-their-favorite-things-0?view=true)

The following four images are concept art for the [Center for American Progress'](https://www.americanprogress.org/) annual fundraising event, the Progressive Party. The first set was a joint project with designer [Erica Mendez-Babcock](http://cargocollective.com/ericambabcock).

The next two images were designed for an open call for art by the [American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclu.org/cases/lesbian-and-gay-rights/fulton-ms-prom-discrimination) when they were fighting for Constance McMillen, a queer Mississippi teen, to be allowed to take her girlfriend to her school's prom.

The next three images were designed as t-shirt and album covers for the bands Edison and [Light Pilot](https://lightpilot.bandcamp.com/), both Nashville-based.

The final image was a revamp of my [high school](http://www.robcoschools.org/shs/home) alma mater's student handbook. I was charged with giving it a much-needed update that would appeal more to the student body.

# Newspaper Design

I became interested in journalism design while working for my high school's newspaper and that passion carried over into college and my first job as a page designer. These pages were designed for the [Hartford Courant](http://www.courant.com/), the [Orlando Sentinel](http://www.orlandosentinel.com/), and my college newspaper, Western Kentucky University's [College Heights Herald](http://wkuherald.com/). See more specialized designs below:
