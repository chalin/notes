So I was recently asked why I prefer to use free and open source software over more conventional and popular proprietary software and services.

A few years ago I was an avid Google user. I was deeply embedded in the Google ecosystem and used their products everywhere. I used Gmail for email, Google Calendar and Contacts for [PIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_information_management), YouTube for entertainment, Google Newsstand for news, Android for mobile, and Chrome as my web browser.

I would upload all of my family photos to Google Photos and all of my personal documents to Google Drive (which were all in Google Docs format). I used Google Domains to register my domain names for websites where I would keep track of my users using Google Analytics and monetize them using Google AdSense.

I used Google Hangouts (one of Google’s previous messaging plays) to communicate with friends and family and Google Wallet (with debit card) to buy things online and in-store.

My home is covered with Google Homes (1 in my office, 1 in my bedroom, 1 in the main living area) which I would use to play music on my Google Play Music subscription and podcasts from Google Podcasts.

I have easily invested thousands of dollars into my Google account to buy movies, TV shows, apps, and Google hardware devices. This was truly the Google life.

Then one day, I received an email from Google that changed everything.

## “Your account has been suspended”

Just the thing you want to wake up to in the morning. An email from Google saying that your account has been suspended due to a perceived Terms of Use violation. No prior warning. No appeals process. No number to call. Trying to sign in to your Google account yields an error and all of your connected devices are signed out. All of your Google data, your photos, emails, contacts, calendars, purchased movies and TV shows. All gone.

I nearly had a heart attack, until I saw that the Google account that had been suspended was in fact not my main personal Google account, but a throwaway Gmail account that I created years prior for a project. I hadn’t touched the other account since creation and forgot it existed. Apparently my personal Gmail was listed as the recovery address for the throwaway account and that’s why I received the termination email.

Although I was able to breathe a sigh of relief this time, the email was wake up call. I was forced to critically reevaluate my dependence on a single company for all the tech products and services in my life.

I found myself to be a frog in a heating pot of water and I made the decision that I was going to jump out.

## Leaving Google

Today there are plenty of lists on the internet providing alternatives to Google services such as [this](https://github.com/tycrek/degoogle) and [this](https://restoreprivacy.com/google-alternatives/). Although the “[DeGoogle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeGoogle)” movement was still in its infancy when I was making the move.

The first Google service I decided to drop was Gmail, the heart of my online identity. I migrated to [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/) with my own domain in case I needed to move again (hint: glad I did, now I self host my email). Fastmail also provided calendar and contacts solutions so that took care of leaving Google Calendar and Contacts.

Here are some other alternatives that I moved to:

- Gmail → [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/) → Self-hosted (via [Cloudron](https://cloudron.io/))
- Google Contacts → [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/) → [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) Contacts
- Google Calendar → [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/) → [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) Calendar
- Google Search → [Bing](https://www.bing.com/) → [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)
- Google Maps → [Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps) → [OpenStreetMaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/)
- Google Analytics → [Matomo Analytics](https://matomo.org/)
- Google Drive → [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) Files
- Google Photos → [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) Files/Gallery
- Google Docs → [Collabora Office](https://nextcloud.com/collaboraonline/) ([Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) integration) and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)
- Google Play Music → [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) / [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) → [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) / [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)
- Google Play Movies/TV → [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) → [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)
- Google Play Audiobooks/Books → [Audible](https://www.audible.com/)/[Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks/)
- Google Play Store (apps) → [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) / [Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com/)
- Google Android → [Lineage OS](https://lineageos.org/) → [Ubuntu Touch](https://ubuntu-touch.io/) on [PinePhone](https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/) (coming soon?)
- Google’s Android Apps → [Simple Mobile Tools](https://www.simplemobiletools.com/)
- Google Chrome → [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
- Google Domains → [Hover](https://www.hover.com/)
- Google Hangouts → [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) and [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) Talk
- Google Allo → [Signal](https://signal.org/)
- Google Podcasts → [PocketCasts](https://www.pocketcasts.com/) → [AntennaPod](https://antennapod.org/)
- Google Newsstand → [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS)
- Google Wallet → [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/home) and [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
- Google Voice →[Ting Mobile](https://ting.com/)

Migrating away from Google was not a fast or easy process. It took years to get where I am now and there are still several Google services that I depend on: YouTube and Google Home.

Eventually, my Google Home’s will grow old and become unsupported at which point hopefully the [Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai/) devices have matured and become available for purchase. YouTube may never be replaced (although I do hope for projects like [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/en/) to succeed) but I find the compromise of using only one or two Google services to be acceptable.

At this point losing my Google account due to a mistake in their machine learning would largely be inconsequential and my focus has shifted to leaving Amazon which I use for most of my shopping and cloud services.

The reason that I moved to mostly [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) applications is that it seems to be the only software ecosystem where everything works seamlessly together and I don’t have to cede control to any single company. Alternatively I could have simply split my service usage up evenly across Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple but I don’t feel that they would have worked as nicely together.

Overall I’m very happy with the open source ecosystem. I use Ubuntu with KDE on all of my computers and Android (no GApps) on my mobile phone. I’ve ordered the [PinePhone “Brave Heart”](https://store.pine64.org/?product=pinephone-braveheart-limited-edition-linux-smartphone-for-early-adaptor) and hope to one day be able to use it or one of its successors as a daily driver with [Ubuntu Touch](https://ubuntu-touch.io/) or [Plasma Mobile](https://www.plasma-mobile.org/).

I don’t want to give the impression that I exclusively use open source software either, I do use a number of proprietary apps including: [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Typora](https://typora.io/), and [Cloudron](https://cloudron.io/).

[@kyle](https://www.kylepiira.com/author/kyle_piira/) The prospect of something like sudden account termination scares the hell out of me, but I'm still very invested with Google. I remain only through some combination of fear, procrastination, and denial. A dangerous trifecta!

[@kyle](https://www.kylepiira.com/author/kyle_piira/) Great writeup, lots of good messages, info, and references.Did you ever find out what caused the account suspension? Was it perhaps hacked, leading to the TOS violation? Or perhaps terminated due to inactivity? Or ?

No I never did find out. I was more worried at the time about Google linking my real account with the temp one (since it was listed as the recovery address) and taking down both.

[@kyle](https://www.kylepiira.com/author/kyle_piira/) I used to use Google for your Domain for the whole family but realised that we were depending too much on the Google ecosystem.We are now using Zimbra, Nextcloud, Collabora Office, Matrix/Synapse. I am waiting for a Librem5 and a PinePhone.The very last step was shared calendars because it was harder to seamlessly integrate with all family members' mobile devices. With Z-Push (activesync) and DavX⁵ (caldav) I finally managed to move everyone to Zimbra calendars last week!

[@kyle](https://www.kylepiira.com/author/kyle_piira/) I’m still surprised that no one’s working on rooting the Echo Dot or Google Home. The current best method for the modern Echo Dot is soldering to sub-mm sized solder points to get r/w access to the eMMC.There are promising bugs in the bootup process that could allow takeover via USB, but I’m nowhere near skilled enough to try (yet).

It was a very good read and well written. I always encourage others to take the same steps you have; Google provides *many* services that give real benefit to people and improve their quality of life but, as you said, for one, you're relying on a single entity for so much. Should a server go down or a data breach occur, millions of people slums be adversely affected. That alone should be reason enough not to use all of their services. Taking the privacy concerns into consideration, however, brings the issue to a whole new level, one that I think many people don't fully appreciate.

[@kyle](https://www.kylepiira.com/author/kyle_piira/) Although I am not a big Google user, I recently moved house and changing address and email address on all my online accounts was a long process, especially as these days most use your email address as a username. There are still 2 accounts that I cannot change my user name on. It was further complicated by the fact that my house was newly built and the postcode was not recognised by most companies' databases, including Google's.I use FOSS as much as I can and avoid Amazon.

Yeah, I really have no idea. Maybe someone at Google was trying to clean up unused accounts. Either way, it still made me realize that I had taken on far more risk than I wanted.

Nice write up. I use some of the alternatives as well and got some tips on more from you, thanks!

For people wanting a Google Keep alternative, check out Standard Notes https://standardnotes.org/

Web, android, iOS, Windows, Linux, free version (I ended up paying, it’s the best app of its type that I’ve seen).

Cloud: the FSFE (European branch of the FSF, Free Software Foundation) motto is, quite correctly, “There is no cloud, only other people computers”).

However, there is a secure “cloud” storage service in Europe, called Tresoreit, rather expensive. Think of it as a Dropbox done right and no CIA, NSA, DIA, FSB, Mossad, MI6 etc. inspection of your files, claiming to be GDPR (DuckDuckGo for it) compliant.
