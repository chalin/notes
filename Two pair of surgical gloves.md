Dr.William wants to operate for three different persons who were wounded in an accident.

But he had only [two pair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands) of [surgical gloves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_glove). There is not any blood contact between the three wounded persons.

How can Dr.William operate for the three people with two pair of surgical gloves?

Solution:

First, Dr.William wear both pair of the [gloves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove), one above the other.

He operate the first person. After finishing he remove the outer pair of gloves as inside out and place it in a tray.

Then operate the [second person](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person). Now he will wear the first gloves as inside out above the second gloves. Operate the third person.

At last he remove the gloves and dispose them.
