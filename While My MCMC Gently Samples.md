#   [Computational Psychiatry: Combining multiple levels of analysis to understand brain disorders - PhD thesis](https://twiecki.io/blog/2019/03/15/computational_psychiatry_thesis/)

Mar 15, 2019

I noticed that as my personal website at my former university went down that my PhD thesis could not be found anywhere, so I'm posting it here.

During my PhD I explored how machine learning and computational modeling of the brain can be used to improve our understanding, and diagnostics …

#   [My foreword to "Bayesian Analysis with Python, 2nd Edition" by Osvaldo Martin](https://twiecki.io/blog/2019/01/21/foreword_bayesian_analysis_with_python/)

Jan 21, 2019

When [Osvaldo](https://twitter.com/aloctavodia) asked me to write the foreword to his new book I felt honored, excited, and a bit scared, so naturally I accepted. What follows is my best attempt to convey what makes probabilistic programming so exciting to me. Osvaldo did a great job with the book, it is …

As advocates of Bayesian statistics in data science we often have to convince business-minded colleagues or customers of the added value of such an approach. While there are many good reasons for applying Bayesian modeling to solve business problems ([Sean J Taylor](https://twitter.com/seanjtaylor) recently had …

Imagine you have a machine learning (ML) problem but only small data (*gasp*, yes, this does exist). This often happens when your data set is nested -- you might have many data points, but only few per category. For example, in ad-tech you may want predict …

#   [An intuitive, visual guide to copulas](https://twiecki.io/blog/2018/05/03/copulas/)

People seemed to enjoy my [intuitive and visual explanation of Markov chain Monte Carlo](https://twiecki.github.io/blog/2015/11/10/mcmc-sampling/) so I thought it would be fun to do another one, this time focused on copulas.

If you ask a statistician what a copula is they might say "a copula is …

#   [What's new in PyMC3 3.1](https://twiecki.io/blog/2017/07/05/new-in-pymc3-31/)

Jul 05, 2017

We recently released [PyMC3 3.1](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md#pymc3-31-june-23-2017) after the first stable 3.0 release in January 2017. You can update either via `pip install pymc3` or via `conda install -c conda-forge pymc3`.

A lot is happening in PyMC3-land. One thing I am particularily proud of is the developer community we have …

#   [Why hierarchical models are awesome, tricky, and Bayesian](https://twiecki.io/blog/2017/02/08/bayesian-hierchical-non-centered/)

Feb 08, 2017

Hierarchical models are underappreciated. Hierarchies exist in many data sets and modeling them appropriately adds a boat load of statistical power (the common metric of statistical power). I provided an introduction to hierarchical models in a [previous blog post: Best Of Both Worlds: Hierarchical Linear …](https://twiecki.github.io/blog/2014/03/17/bayesian-glms-3/)

Jul 05, 2016

Recently, I blogged about [Bayesian Deep Learning with PyMC3](https://twiecki.github.io/blog/2016/06/01/bayesian-deep-learning/) where I built a simple hand-coded Bayesian Neural Network and fit it on a toy data set. Today, we will build a more interesting model using [Lasagne](https://lasagne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a flexible `Theano` library for constructing various types of …
