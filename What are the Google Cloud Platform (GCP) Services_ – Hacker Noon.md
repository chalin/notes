What are the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Services? – Hacker Noon

# What are the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Services?

## Described without… help from marketing

*> See Also*> : > [> What is Google’s Cloud Platform (described using on the 1,000 most commonly used words)?](https://medium.com/@retomeier/how-the-big-search-company-lets-you-use-their-computers-to-do-your-own-stuff-b393a3aa0cc3#.x7y23ngyj)

[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/products/) (GCP) offers dozens of [IaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure_as_a_service_.28IaaS.29), [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Platform_as_a_service_.28PaaS.29), and [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Software_as_a_service_.28SaaS.29) services. Sadly, the Wikipedia entry for GCP is garbage, and while the official docs are pretty good, the marketing-dust sprinkled on them gives me a toothache. For my own reference, I pulled together an objective description for each of the services available on GCP.

Big hat-tip to [Greg Wilson](https://medium.com/@gregsramblings), the Google Cloud Developer Relations team, and the Google Cloud Developer Experts for the 4-word descriptions.
