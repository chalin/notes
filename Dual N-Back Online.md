# Dual N-Back

Dual N-Back is a professional-grade brain training game.

### It makes you smarter!

Unlike many other brain training exercises Dual N-Back is proven to transfer training results to other brain activities. This effect has been confirmed by a number of scientific studies.

"Fluid intelligence (Gf) refers to the ability to reason and to solve new problems independently of previously acquired knowledge. Gf is critical for a wide variety of cognitive tasks, and it is considered one of the most important factors in learning. Moreover, Gf is closely related to professional and educational success, especially in complex and demanding environments."

### How To Start

The Dual N-Back game field is a square separated to smaller squares with lines (like 3x3 cross-zero game field).

During the game the image is shown in one of the game squares.

Your task is to find a match of the current position of the image to the position shown one (or two) step earlier. If there was a match, press the corresponding match key. Same thing for the auditory letters. Just listen and try to remember the letters from the previous steps.
