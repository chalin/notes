GKE status

The team posts slides toÂ [go/gke-slides](https://goto.google.com/gke-slides).

I don't think we have a comprehensive concise description of the current state.

1.6 hopefully will ship this month. It will (officially) scale to 5000 nodes and support etcd3. Spark integration is coming. A bunch of scheduling features will advance to beta (pod and node affinity/anti-affinity, taints and tolerations+forgiveness, multiple schedulers). DaemonSet rolling updates. Service catalog (fronting the Open Service Broker API) will be alpha, I think. Cluster federation is coming along.
