# Introduction to Data Science in Python

**About this course: **This course will introduce the learner to the basics of the python programming environment, including how to download and install python, expected fundamental python programming techniques, and how to find help with python programming questions. The course will also introduce data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduce the abstraction of the DataFrame as the central data structure for data analysis. The course will end with a statistics primer, showing how various statistical measures can be applied to pandas DataFrames. By the end of the course, students will be able to take tabular data, clean it,  manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses.

This course should be taken before any of the other Applied Data Science with Python courses: Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python, Applied Machine Learning in Python, Applied Text Mining in Python, Applied Social Network Analysis in Python.

**Who is this class for: **This course is part of “Applied Data Science with Python“ and is intended for learners who have basic python or programming background, and want to apply statistics, machine learning, information visualization, social network analysis, and text analysis techniques to gain new insight into data.

Only minimal statistics background is expected, and the first course contains a refresh of these basic concepts. There are no geographic restrictions. Learners with a formal training in Computer Science but without formal training in data science will still find the skills they acquire in these courses valuable in their studies and careers.

Nice course but the assignment is too hard for the beginner, and the assignment and the course materials are not match enough. We have to do a lot self-study when doing the homework. But the skills I learnt from the course is really useful.

This course is very well formatted and designed. You get to learn the basics and will have chance to have hands on some live data. The mentors are really helpful for any help that you need for your assignments.

Very informative course. It's a little fast paced but you can always go back and watch the videos again. It teaches the basics of pandas with a focus on how to prepare your data before starting working on it

You certainly need to do your own research (Google, StackOverflow, pandas documentation) to complete the assignments.

The mentors on the forums are the best! Without their help I would have been lost.
