THE CLOUD

THAT WORKS LIKE

ONE SINGLE MACHINE

 ![Container-native Cloud, Docker, Container](../_resources/5fb940d91fae20d6f37ef1f6182b8ded.png)

## Run containers on demand

In Hyper.sh, there is no VM, cluster, or scheduler to setup. Simply pull the image and run it:

- `hyper pull nginx`

- `hyper run nginx`

 ![Container-native Cloud, Docker, Container](../_resources/3700d4e45f07bb434aa37b9ce0ce750a.png)

## 5-seconds Provisioning

Yes, `hyper run nginx [logo_single.svg](../_resources/a29bab126a5d8cb9b6fa71bc41540dce.png)`, your application will be up and running in 5 seconds!

 ![Container-native Cloud, Docker, Container](../_resources/1d4da28fb2ee15f9035b8549b381a6f1.png)

## Per Second Billing

Launch in 5 seconds, run for 30s, shutdown in 1s. Pay as little as 5+30+1=36 seconds!

 ![Container-native Cloud, Docker, Container](../_resources/6847096386c54c2a73f8d5b94ebdbac6.png)

## Consistent with Docker

`hyper pull`, `hyper run`, `hyper exec`. You know Docker, you know us!

 ![Container-native Cloud, Docker, Container](../_resources/43566f15f2bb228682270349262bd3f2.png)

## Secure as VM

All containers are born with the hardware-enforced isolation in Hyper.sh. The same level of security as VM.

EVERYTHING YOU WANT,

NATIVELY ON CONTAINER

 ![Container-native Cloud, Docker, Container](../_resources/8c1e719ebf9c4eebfcf3906c1c74dcd5.png)

## Nano Instance

Don't launch a 512MB VM just for a cron job. We offer nano containers, as tiny as 64MB.

 ![Container-native Cloud, Docker, Container](../_resources/2c593c0a45560e384a72832ceffacacf.png)

## Persistent Volume

Your containers are attached with EBS-like volumes. The data is automatically replicated, distributed and protected from failures. Moreover, you can create snapshots for backup/restore.

 ![Container-native Cloud, Docker, Container](../_resources/25731262fef0d17f86f37a2f79e984a5.png)

## Private Network

Your containers will run in your own Layer-2 network. Your traffic is completely isolated from other users and the rest of the world!

USE CASES

 ![CI / CD, Docker, Container](../_resources/677dde194b2e3801e0a2eb8393f1cbee.png)

CI / CD

Hyper.sh is the optimal container hosting service to create your CI/CD pipeline. No more long running costly VMs sitting waiting for build jobs. With Hyper.sh you only pay when you’re building.

 ![Dev / Test, Docker, Container](../_resources/82f8c9050ecbb4149b1b84db77964284.png)

Dev / Test

Hyper.sh allows you to focus on code. With our Docker native workflow, and no VM clusters to manage or upfront planning to perform, developing on Hyper.sh is the same as on your laptop. You know Docker, you know Hyper.sh.

 ![Serverless, Docker, Container](:/95be1eedef43d8df206bb5e3cace0150)

Serverless

Build out your own serverless platform or app on Hyper.sh. The combination of incredibly fast boot times, coupled with strong isolation and ease of use, makes Hyper.sh a perfect service to run your event-driven workloads.

 ![Demo / Poc, Docker, Container](../_resources/70befb09e5d7b33ce65536b7c1cebe99.png)

Demo / Poc

Need to showcase your new project or app? Deploying to Hyper.sh is incredible fast and with a few Docker commands, your app is up and running for the world to see.

WHAT OUR USERS ARE SAYING

- We use Docker on prem and Hyper.sh as failover cloud. Since both sides have Docker, everything works 100% out of the box.

 Hareem Haque
 Sigma Global Solutions

- Hyper.sh looks pretty competitive with Docker Cloud, or better with per-second billing, floating ips, monitoring, logging

 TJ Holowaychuk
 Founder of Apex and Express.js

- Combination of Gitlab CI and Hyper.sh makes container build/deployment remarkably painless. Impressed!

 Mark Woodbridge
 CTO at Chaser.io

- Hyper.sh's Docker super-set REST API made it a breeze to write support for buildbot! and Thanks to their per second billing Hyper.sh came in around 10 times cheaper for our continuous integration workloads!

 Pierre Tardy
 Technical Lead at Buildbot.net

- Hyper.sh makes it super simple for developers to launch containers in the cloud today. And the best bit is if you already know the Docker command line tools, then you already know how to use Hyper.sh!

 Gareth Rushgrove
 Senior Software Engineer at Puppet

- Running containers directly through an API with zero concerns about host/cluster resources allowed us to focus entirely on our application logic. The per-second pricing was icing on the cake.

 Conor Nash
 Data Science Consulting

- Having a lot of fun playing with Hyper.sh. Good design, easy UX, and the feature-set is minimal, mostly what you need.

 Diogo Monica
 Security Lead at Docker
