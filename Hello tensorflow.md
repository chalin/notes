hello tensorflow hello-tensorflow A small example of using tensorflow.js notwaldorf Remix on Glitch View Source Machine Learning (ML) is the dope new thing that everyone's talking about, because it's really good at learning from data so that it can predict similar things in the future. Doing ML by hand is pretty annoying since it usually involves matrix math which is zero fun in JavaScript (or if you ask me: anywhere ). Thankfully, TensorFlow.js is here to help! It's an open source library that has a lot of built-in Machine Learning-y things like models and algorithms so that you don't have to write them from scratch.
