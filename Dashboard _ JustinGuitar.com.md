**Welcome to the Justin Guitar Practice Assistant! :)**

Here you'll be able to construct an amazing practice routine, edit a template routine to suit your own needs or get suggested routines from various courses (like each lesson of the 2020 Beginner Course!). It's going to take me a while to get practice items for all lessons, but you should be able to make your own pretty easily.

**Practice Items**

Before you make a routine, you'll need to make a practice item to put in it. You can specify the item name, the duration for practice and also a statistic to chart (like metronome speed or number of chord changes).

**Practice Routines**

Once you have some items you can structure them into a Routine, change the order of them - and make a number of different routines if you want to. Note that 'archiving items' removes them from the routines - so don't archive items unless you're done practicing them!

Just make a new routine and then choose the items you want in it!
**Practice**

Once you got a routine you can start practice! Just click the start arrow and off you go. You can add notes as well which will be saved with the item for anything you need to remember to work on.

**Stats**

Our stats are basic for now but we're working on more fun things for this area - right now it'll rack time spent practicing and also the stats for items (chord changes or metronome speeds, that kind of thing).

**Metronome**

You'll also find a metronome you can use when wanted, easy to use basic metronome with subdivisions!

**Pricing**
