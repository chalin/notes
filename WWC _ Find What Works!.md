## Welcome to the What Works Clearinghouse

The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) reviews the existing research on different *programs*, *products*, *practices*, and *policies* in education. *Our goal* is to provide educators with the information they need to make evidence-based decisions. We focus on the results from *high-quality research* to answer the question “What works in education?” Find more information [about the WWC](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/WhoWeAre).
