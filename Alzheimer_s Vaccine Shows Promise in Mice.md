Alzheimer's Vaccine Shows Promise in Mice MONDAY, Nov. 26, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental Alzheimer's disease vaccine shows promise in animal tests, and researchers say it could have the potential to reduce dementia cases by half. In mice created to develop Alzheimer's, the vaccine triggered an immune response that reduced accumulation of two toxic proteins associated with the fatal brain disease. There was a 40 percent reduction in beta-amyloid proteins and up to a 50 percent reduction in tau proteins, with no harmful side effects, according to researchers at the University of Texas.
