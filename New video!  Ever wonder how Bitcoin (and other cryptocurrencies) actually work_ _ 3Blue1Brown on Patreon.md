Hello all,

One thing I've enjoyed doing in past videos is putting together a narrative for how the viewer could reasonably have invented the relevant piece of math themselves.  Admittedly, there's always something a little contrived in doing this, since the actual process of discovery involves many more wrong turns than a ~20-minute video can allow, but it's a pattern among many expository works that I've personally found to be most helpful.

I thought it might be fun to do something similar for cryptocurrencies.  Any math video has a certain public-service motivation behind it, but whereas for most videos that motivation revolves very generally around people learning more and liking math more, this topic is a little more targeted.  As I say in the video, cryptocurrencies have attracted a lot of attention as objects of speculation, but I'm not so sure that this speculation carries with it a commensurate deeper understanding.

Also, cryptography is just really neat, and it's something I'll likely talk about more in future videos.  How exactly public key protocols work, for example, is rich with some very good math.

Curious to hear what you think of this one, -Grant

Oh Exciting! Love the topic, and this is the first I've seen of the math behind it
