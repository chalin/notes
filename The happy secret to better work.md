We believe we should work hard in order to be happy, but could we be thinking about things backwards? In this fast-moving and very funny talk, psychologist Shawn Achor argues that, actually, happiness inspires us to be more productive.

This talk was presented to a local audience at TEDxBloomington, an independent event. TED's editors chose to feature it for you.
