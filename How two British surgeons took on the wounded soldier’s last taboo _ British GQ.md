# How two British surgeons took on the wounded soldier’s last taboo

By [Jonathan Heaf](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/profile/jonathan-heaf)22 May 2018

During the worst years of the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, hundreds of servicemen were flown to one hospital in Birmingham, where pioneering medics learned to treat injuries previously thought unsurvivable. Their legacy – and a legacy of that war – is the amputee servicemen whose lives they saved. And yet, as they explain, the worst physical injuries remain unseen – and almost always unspoken. Here, *GQ* hears the stories of men who lost not only limbs but genitalia in service to their country

## Sunday 15 November 2009

Warrant Officer Ken Bellringer of 11 Explosives Ordnance Disposal Regiment (EOD), Royal Logistics Corps, had only been back from leave for two weeks. The respite had been worthwhile physically. He’d also got to spend time with his wife and two young children; ever since serving in [Northern Ireland during the Troubles](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/terrorism-northern-ireland-the-troubles-new-ira) he’d promised himself he would try to take more time off. Yet, if truth be told, his mind hadn’t strayed far from the sandy churn of Helmand province, [Afghanistan](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/sonita-review), the noise of the CH-47 Chinook blades, the waft of the canteen tent and the acrid dust that gets in between every stitch, inside every pore. War isn’t something you’re supposed to miss, is it? Still, as darkness fell in Balderton, Nottinghamshire, he found his mind would drift back east to where the rest of his regiment was under fire and in danger.

Once back “in theatre” it didn’t take long for Bellringer’s reverie to be broken. The moment his plane touched down in Camp Bastion – the British Army base northwest of the city of Lashkar Gah – his duty officer informed him a close friend had been killed that very day. It was the second colleague he had lost since having been deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick XI earlier that year.

He didn’t break down, not like the last time; he didn’t allow grief’s venom to flood into his system. Bellringer had learned to go numb in order to work. He took it in whole, like Wile E Coyote swallowing a stick of dynamite, and forced it down to the pit of his stomach where the [tragedy](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/donald-trump-las-vegas-warmest) detonated silently. War, he knew, had no patience for such sorrow.

As part of the EOD, Bellringer’s role in Afghanistan was to help find and defuse the myriad improvised explosive devices (IEDs) put down by the Taliban in order to kill and maim his fellow servicemen. His ability to maintain a level head amid the chaos of war was – more than most – not only a matter of his own life and death, but also the life and death of his fellow soldiers, who would be, quite literally, following in his footsteps. “So I shrugged it off,” he explains of the tragic news. “I gathered my team and went out on the ground.”

> Putting a man back together comes with immense challenges… We had never seen all these injuries on someone who was alive

It was a Sunday. Sundays had come to be known in [Camp Bastion](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/help-4-heroes) as “Holy Shit Sundays”, at least by the medics. It was the darkest day of the week, when rumour had it the Taliban were most likely to strike. They would stop for Friday prayers, plan their attacks on Saturday and carry them out the following day. That was the theory anyway, although as most found out while serving in a conflict area, theory counted for very little when engaged with a guerrilla enemy whose tactics were so purposefully unpredictable.

The morning call, or “task”, came in to Bellringer’s team. Six devices had been discovered along a narrow track in the vicinity of Patrol Base Sandford in the Gereshk area of Helmand, about an hour and a half from Bastion. The Taliban specialised in burying bombs along such paths: slim walkways of dirt and rock, sometimes the only entry or exit to a particularly inviting strategic point. “We found the first device pretty quickly,” Bellringer recalls. “From start to finish we could find, deactivate and clear a device in around 20 minutes; we were fast.”

Here’s how Bellringer’s team would go about clearing such a minefield. Operating in a core team of three – with the other men taking cover from potential enemy engagement behind a tree line – a lead man would go ahead sweeping with a metal detector while the other two kept around ten metres behind. If and when the lead found something of interest it would be marked and investigated thoroughly.

“We were very experienced and had been acclimatised to the heat. We’d got our eye in. We knew what bumps and irregularities to look for. After immediate deployment I spent weeks training in the test lanes at Bastion, looking for the smallest sign of a man-made disturbance, a single raised stone or unnatural discolouration, anything to indicate a bomb.”

> That’s when I realised he’d stepped on a device… When that happens you don’t know how long you’ve got

The lead man that day was Corporal Loren Marlton-Thomas, 28, known to his comrades as “Loz”. On that narrow footpath, however, in the middle of mud the colour of tooth decay, Corporal Marlton-Thomas found himself stuck. “He was out in front, a very experienced guy, very reliable,” recalls Bellringer. “He turns to me, about three metres from where I am, and just says, ‘Mate, I’m stuck. Really, I’m stuck.’”

Bellringer gave a chuckle, more out of bewilderment than anything. Yet it wasn’t long before he realised how grave the situation was. “I can see he’s got both feet down what looks like a rabbit hole. I come over to where he is and can see this “hole” has got straight edges. This is not a good sign. A rabbit doesn’t make a hole with straight edges. That’s when I realise he’s stepped on a device. It’s not functioned, not blown obviously, but by stepping on it and getting trapped he has now altered its state. When that happens you don’t know how long you have got.”

Corporal Marlton-Thomas and Warrant Officer Bellringer were now in a “category A” situation. (Civilians might call it something a lot cruder.) “A category A situation is where EOD operations commence regardless of the risk to the operator’s life,” says Bellringer. “We’re told if there is nothing you can do, and you know categorically a device is about to go off – imagine it’s a movie and you can see the timer counting down – then you’re supposed to make an excuse and get out of there yourself, perhaps say you’re just going to get a piece of equipment... That wasn’t the case here. The device hadn’t gone off. I tried moving my foot around the outside of the edges, looking for perhaps a wire that was running off to a battery – nothing. Still, I thought there was a good chance it had malfunctioned. So I was going to get him out. He needed help. There was no way I was just going to leave him. So I grabbed him under the arms and I pulled.”

## A unique constellation of injuries

Despite his extensive experience, Demetrius Evriviades – the principal plastic surgeon in the reconstruction of [injured soldiers in Afghanistan](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/prince-harry-birthday) – had to steel himself if he was back on the wards of the Queen Elizabeth in Birmingham, the hospital where all British military personnel ended up after being shot, blown up or severely hurt in Afghanistan.

According to records, the medical staff at the Elizabeth – replacing the Selly Oak hospital down the road – treated 218 very seriously injured and 222 seriously injured service personnel from Afghanistan between 2006 and October 2010. One hundred and five were given surgical amputations, while figures from the British Limbless Ex-Serviceman’s Association (Blesma) suggest that of those, 12 were triple amputees while 48 lost both legs. More recently, medics at the Elizabeth reconstructed the damaged face of Nobel Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, after she was shot by the Taliban and left for dead in 2012.

Warrant Officer Ken Bellringer's honours include the Medal For Long Service And Good Conduct, awarded after 15 years in the forces.

Ken Bellringer would have arrived here some time on Monday 16 November – less than 24 hours after Corporal Marlton-Thomas stepped on the IED in Gereshk. While Corporal Marlton-Thomas tragically died – the 28-year-old Royal Engineer wasn’t found until the following day, having been blown into a wadi some distance from the blast site – Bellringer survived. His injuries, however, were the worst the staff at the Queen Elizabeth, including Evriviades, had ever seen. The warrant officer and father had lost both legs above the knee, extensively damaged both his hands and arms and suffered a shattered pelvis, including the loss of both testicles.

Bellringer would have been medevaced from the field by a medical emergency response team (MERT). He’d have been placed in an induced coma while surgeons at Camp Bastion battled to stem the bleeding, stabilised his vital signs and, essentially, saved his life. He would then have been flown back to the UK direct from Camp Bastion, wheeled past his family on a gurney and gone straight into the operating theatre, a smudged “M” in black marker still visible on his forehead, written by those who first attended to his injuries, administering morphine for pain relief.

“I had served for 22 years in the armed forces,” says Evriviades. “I ended up going to Afghanistan twice, working out in Helmand. The rest of the time I was based in Selly Oak and then the new Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where facilities were much improved. Between working here in the UK and out at Bastion, I had two very different experiences of the war.

“It was very busy operating out in Helmand, but I never lost sleep worrying about whether I had treated someone correctly, about whether or not I had done the right thing. Out in Afghanistan, procedures were more or less binary: they were bleeding to death, you stopped the bleeding; there were bits of them that were dead, you chop those bits off. You fill them with blood, warm the patient up, put them on a plane, send them back to Britain...”

Evriviades is wary about how cavalier this might sound, yet all he is trying to do is underline the staggering challenges faced during this unique period of time back on the wards of the Queen Elizabeth. It was an exceptional, somewhat desperate situation and one that, despite its bloodiness, heralded some incredible, pioneering medical procedures.

> Every operation is another insult to the body. Patients’ lives hung by a thread

“It was the constellation of injuries we were faced with,” he explains. “With the advancements in modern field medicine, or forward care, we were now able to save men and women who had suffered extremely complicated and severe injuries out in Afghanistan, whereas only a few years before they would have certainly died. Putting a man back together who is in such a bad shape, however, comes with immense challenges.

“Not only are we talking about singular missing limbs, but multiple lost limbs and also proximal injuries around the perineum, the anus, rectum and the genitals. We had never seen all these different serious injuries on someone who was alive before. All of these injuries on one person makes things very complicated. Even if you survive the blood loss you can get very sick from infection and can’t be operated on. Every operation is yet another insult to the body. You had patients whose lives were hanging by a thread and we had to try to fix them without tipping them over the edge.”

Being one of the first surgeons to operate on such a “constellation” of injuries, Evriviades found himself a somewhat accidental pioneer: there was no literature to refer to, nowhere to look anything up. “In many ways it was going back to the birth of plastic surgery after the Great War. Harold Gillies invented what we now consider plastic surgery to be and much of his work was done in the dark, at a special ward at the Cambridge Military Hospital in Aldershot – treating men with terrible facial injuries from fragment-filled shells.” Just like Gillies, Evriviades had nothing to refer to. It was innovation. “I wouldn’t say I made it up as I went along,” the surgeon says, smiling, “but I certainly had to think on my feet.”

Bomb disposal office Ken Bellringer was injured in Helmand province in November 2009. He had been helping a soldier who stepped on an IED when the device detonated. The other soldier, Corporal Loren Marlton-Thomas, was killed.

This intense period during the [Afghanistan conflict](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/war-reporting) – from around 2006 to 2009 – was a unique moment in modern warfare and thus a unique period for the medicine being applied back home. The Taliban had realised that engaging allied forces in “kinetics” – small arms fire – was getting them nowhere; they were entirely outgunned. So rather than continue to engage troop-for-troop, the Taliban started laying thousands of crudely built IEDs all over the country, basic explosives buried in the ground. With the preferred way of conducting counterinsurgency operations being on foot, the Taliban’s rudimentary tactics worked. The devastating effects of IEDs ripped through the allied forces, the resulting injuries savaging morale both for the men serving and those back in Britain waiting to be deployed.

“It was the extent and location of the injuries that caught our attention,” continues Evriviades, who graduated from Liverpool Medical School in 1994 and trained as a plastic surgeon in Oxford and Trent. “With the advances in frontline medicine, we were seeing men return with injuries never seen before on those still alive, specifically injuries to the lower abdomen.”

Despite the upsurge in IEDs, the body armour issued to the British forces at the time, although effective against small arms fire, didn’t especially protect the lower body, the legs or the genitals against a blast from below. Although the Ministry Of Defence worked hard, and quickly, to issue “ballistic boxers” – heavy-duty silk cycling shorts that helped prevent secondary infections from fine sand particles thrown up by explosives – these weren’t field-tested until the summer of 2011. (Later on, several tiers of protection were added to the “boxers”, making them more effective.)

It was groin injuries that caused Evriviades the most concern and gave him the greatest challenges as a plastic surgeon. Before pelvic protection was widely deployed, the signature injury, certainly in regard to the first half of the [conflict in Afghanistan](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/anthony-loyd-war-correspondent-fishing), was “bilateral high-leg amputation with severe injury to the anorectum, necessitating a colostomy, and severe genitourethral injury”. In short, genital trauma, for some of the most severely injured servicemen, started becoming a real concern. Almost ten years on, however, it is still a topic, an issue and an injury that is hardly ever talked about. It is the injured serviceman’s last taboo.

> The psychological impact of losing their genitals is greater than losing a limb

There is a poignant contradiction in regards to the fact that one’s genitals aren’t necessary for maintaining life, yet for so many, they are entirely vital for living a certain quality of life. “These weren’t considered life-saving operations, medically speaking,” Evriviades says. “When it comes to patient care, genital injuries aren’t even considered until some time after being admitted into care. Most have this work done as outpatients once off the main wards. This is at odds, of course, with the priority given to this by the actual patients: what, in all likelihood, is the very first question a soldier asks after being hit by an IED? ‘Doc, have I still got my balls?’

“We found the psychological impact of losing their genitals was far greater then the impact of losing, say, a limb even. Imagine lying in a hospital bed having survived a blast and reaching under the covers between your legs but feeling nothing. Now imagine being 19 years old. And being in an organisation such as the army.”

## New ‘signature trauma’

Radial forearm phalloplasty is the procedure many trans men go through when they want a sex change. Essentially, it is a transfer of tissue – the radial artery, cephalic vein and numerous nerves – from the forearm of the patient to reconstruct the penis and urethra. The problem Evriviades and his colleagues faced with badly injured servicemen, such as Ken Bellringer, is that they were arriving as single, double or even triple amputees to the ward. Either their forearms weren’t there or, as in many cases, the blast damage to their arms was far too severe to be used for the phalloplasty.

Another challenge was “the plumbing”. This is where Evriviades called on the help of Paul Anderson, who, naturally, grew up watching *M*A*S*H*, yet eventually specialised in urology. “I ended up working in a department specialising in urology and plastic surgery, doing mainly genitourethral reconstructive surgery,” Anderson explains.

“When all the victims from Afghanistan began coming back to the Queen Elizabeth, especially with this signature groin injury to the perineum, I was asked to come and consult, first on an ad hoc basis and then more regularly. This was when Demetrius and I would work together. As the number of men with severe genitourinary trauma increased, it became very apparent that they needed a multidisciplinary approach.

> The first time I died I was in that ditch. My lung collapsed, as well as everything else

“I had been dealing with a lot of civilian injuries up to this point,” Anderson continues. “Things like crush injuries to the pelvis or genital injuries due to road traffic accidents. This is where, much like a blast victim, the various pipes – the urethra, the tube that conducts urine and semen from the bladder and ejaculatory ducts, and so on – can be ripped out or severed. I worked in tandem with Demetrius to provide better care for these servicemen, who were, understandably, more concerned about what could be done about their genital injuries than anything else. It was the sheer number of these injuries we were seeing that was unprecedented. Although the Americans were getting far more of the severely injured, their patients were being looked after by almost 20 hospitals across the States. In Britain it was just us at the Queen Elizabeth. It meant we learned a lot very quickly.”

The joint clinic, starting around February 2009, was there to assess and offer surgical help to those servicemen whose genitals had been severely damaged or destroyed during the war. Men such as Rifleman Andy Searle, who, like Bellringer, was injured by an IED in Afghanistan. Searle, from Torquay, signed up to the army when he was only 16. “I always wanted to do it as a kid, then just before I left school I signed up. I forged my mum’s signature at the careers office.” By the age of 19 (in May 2011) he was on a flight out of RAF Brize Norton being taken to Camp Bastion. The tour was due to last six months; he only completed one before he was injured.

“I remember being stunned initially,” he explains of his bomb blast. Only ten days prior to this Searle had been on his hands and knees, covered in blood, trying to save the life of his commander, who also had stepped on an IED, severing both legs above the knee. His commander never made it.

“I just took two steps and ‘boom’,” he recalls about being hit. “I remember flying through the air, a lot of heat and then landing in an irrigation ditch.” Records have since informed Searle that he died a total of four times that day. “I think the first time I died I was in that ditch. My lung collapsed, as well as everything else. Luckily we had a good navy medic who knew what to do and got tubes down my throat. I just wished I could have had some morphine; they can’t administer it if your blood pressure is too low. It’ll kill you.”

In May 2011, aged 19, Rifleman Andy Searle deployed to Afghanistan with the Rifles Regiment and in June of the same year he was injured by an IED. He was treated by Demetrius Evriviades and Paul Anderson at a specialist unit in Birmingham.

Back in Birmingham, he spent four to five weeks drifting in and out of consciousness. “I guess my injuries didn’t really hit home until I asked my mum to take my socks off because my feet felt really hot. She was like, ‘What are you on about? You have no legs, son.’ I had a five per cent chance of living, mainly because of the infection from the ditch and the blast. My surgeons, Demetrius and Paul, were learning so much from all the men coming back injured from the front line that I was told had I been injured just six months before I would have died, as they wouldn’t have known the things they did.”

Although he’d survived the initial blast, Searle’s battle had only just begun. “Once in Birmingham, they kept cutting my legs higher and higher to stop the infections I was getting, the last point taking it all the way up to my hip. That’s how I lost my genitals. I lost one testicle in the initial blast, but because of the infection and poor blood supply my penis and other testicle just died. They just cut it off.”

> There was a line we wouldn’t cross. The emotional side of our injuries was quite a hard thing to discuss openly

Today, Searle is in the final stages of having a new penis made for him by Evriviades. “My new penis is made up from lots of different parts of me, essentially,” he explains candidly. “As my forearms were too badly damaged, they had to make the main bulk of it from part of my abdomen.”

A coiled piece of skin, called a pedicle, was cut and attached to where Searle’s new penis would be, essentially attaching part of his back to his groin. By not severing the donor tissue completely and moving it wholesale, it meant the blood flow was kept continuous, allowing for a higher chance of a successful skin graft and acceptance by the body. “The tip of my penis is made from the skin underneath my scalp, for it’s colour and potential sensitivity. The urethra, Paul’s work, was made from the skin lining the inside of my mouth, as it needs to be able to stay continuously wet.”

Length, it turns out, was up to him – although there were limits. “Well, it’s pretty long at the moment, as why not?” he says, chuckling. “Although this might change, as I keep damaging it.” Damaging it? “Yes. I sometimes get it out in town. Last time I started doing the helicopter with it in club. Think I may have whacked it on a table edge. Also, I’m a keen scuba diver and when I went diving in Egypt I wasn’t changing the dressing as much as I should have been.” Army, it turns out, will always be army. Searle’s stoicism, bravery and robustness is, frankly, staggering.

Does Searle ever think about whether or not he will have sex again? Is having children possible? Or is just the fact that he’s alive enough? “After my testicles were gone, they give you testosterone replacement injections and that was very frustrating. It’s not that I want a girlfriend, that has passed, really, but if the option is there to have a penis back I’ll take it. It would make me feel that much closer to being whole again. It’s your manhood, isn’t it?”

And having sex, how would this work? “Implants and injections. The trouble is, I lost so much of my pelvic bone they are finding it hard to anchor the implant anywhere. At the moment, I can pee out of a hole underneath my penis. Still, it’s far better than it was. It’s good looking down there and seeing something. I have actually chosen to stop with my prosthetics, my limbs, and focus on my genital injuries. To be honest, I am never going to walk properly again. I would rather have my penis back than walk on my stumps.”

“Remember, the penis isn’t just the penis,” says Anderson. “It is much more than just something to pee out of. The injured servicemen who had the catheters put in despise them and would love their penis to work again so they could pee normally. For someone who is sedentary, not moving, the catheters are especially painful because the patients produce more salt in their urine, giving rise to bladder stones, pain and infection. If it’s a question of reconnecting the existing pipes, it’s a challenging operation but it’s not as hard as creating an entire new penis from scratch – and that is where I would let Demetrius take the lead.”

“There were essentially two different types of genital injury coming back from Afghanistan,” explains Evriviades. “There’s rebuilding a damaged penis and there’s a complete reconstruction. From here, there are three different options, three levels of surgery. You can create something that looks like a penis, a pant-filler, so to speak, which psychologically is very important. Secondly, you can create something that the men can take out at a urinal and pee from – again this is really important psychologically.

> We talk about leg injuries. We talk about prosthetics…. Why not talk about our genital injuries, our sexuality and how this will be affected?

“Lastly, you can create something the men can have sex with, which involves placing an implant in, one where they actually get an erection and have satisfying sexual intercourse. If the nerves are joined up and the operation is a success, there are some men who will have real sensitivity down there; you touch their penis and they will tell you you are touching their penis – much like a successful hand transplant. For some men, harvesting sperm is entirely possible. Some men can still reach orgasm. And some of my patients have gone on to have children.”

## The emotional toll

Through charities, such as Help For Heroes or HRH Prince Harry’s Invictus Games sporting programme, as well as the success of the 2012 Paralympics in London, British servicemen with missing limbs have become a well-known symbol of the war in Afghanistan. What is rarely spoken about is genital damage. For many of those injured it is cloaked in shame, stigma and embarrassment. This is the first time victims such as Ken Bellringer and Andy Searle have gone on record about these specific injuries and their lasting effects. Both, they tell me, wish more men would speak out about it.

Bellringer, who has since left the forces, has spent a great deal of time thinking about how to move forward positively with such injuries, although he’s the first to admit that because of his age and his marital status, his lot is somewhat easier than the psychological challenges a much younger man would face. “I’d lost my legs. I’d lost my testicles,” he explains, “but I had my penis, or part of it anyway. It had been pulled inside my abdomen [by the blast] and that was hard to understand and deal with, but I was married, I’d already had my kids – so that side of my life was done.”

I ask Bellringer if he talked about his genital injuries to any of his fellow servicemen on the wards in Birmingham. “To be honest, we brushed over it,” he says thoughtfully. “I think we all knew to a certain extent, but even with the good humour – you know, army lads – it wasn’t something we talked about. There was a line we wouldn’t cross. The emotional side of our injuries was quite a hard thing to discuss openly. We had Paul and Demetrius dealing with our physical injuries so brilliantly, but I never felt that way with my [mental injuries](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/bear-grylls-mental-health). There was no focus on it.

“I would have liked to have known more about my options or making the most of what I have. Sex toys, [how to use Viagra properly](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/viagra-over-the-counter) and so on, also things like Caverject injections, which are used to treat [erectile problems](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/erectile-dysfunction-causes-treatment-gp-advice). We were offered these things, but nothing was really talked through. You know, there’s more to sex than just penetration – men, even men with injuries such as mine, need to know that. It’s not just about the medicine and the treatment. It’s about education. We talk about leg injuries. We talk about prosthetics. We talk about our hands and the progress with transplants. Why not talk about our genital injuries, our sexuality and how this will be affected? It should be made more matter-of-fact.”

> Some things, no matter how much we learn or push the science, are beyond even our reach

Bellringer knows that it’s one thing to come home to a wife and two children – whatever the injuries – and quite another thing to come home from war as a 19-year-old man like Andy Searle, with such genitourinary injuries and the pelvic area completely destroyed. “It’s part of their identity as a man,” agrees Evriviades. “It’s not just a physical injury, far from it. And in many ways, it makes no sense that a genital injury, such an important psychological one, is among the very last to be dealt with. It can erode a patient’s feeling of self-worth and many feel they are unable to talk about such wounds, to their friends or even their loved ones. This makes them even higher risk for suicide.”

New hope for some of these men comes in the form of a complete penile transplant. Research in the United States, led by surgeons from the Johns Hopkins University School Of Medicine in Baltimore, has seen some success with this, although the risk of infection is very high and the treatment could cost between £150,000 and £300,000, mainly due to the expensive anti-rejection drug programme the patient would have to go on, probably for the rest of their lives.

The project has been years in the making, with extensive research on cadavers. This work includes injecting brightly coloured food dyes into the bodies to map out the circularity system in the penis. Whether or not servicemen – and their partners – can get used to the idea that their most intimate body part came from another man is yet to be seen.

The Afghan conflict, for [British troops](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/style-for-soldiers) at least, is mostly over. But there will be other conflicts, inevitably. We must make certain the knowledge garnered by Paul Anderson and Demetrius Evriviades, their work with Ken Bellringer and Andy Searle, as well as all the other patients and medical experts, is documented, passed on and built upon. In honour of those soldiers who didn’t make it home, men such as Corporal Loren Marlton-Thomas, we must make sure this pioneering work, which has only just begun, continues.

At the end of the day, all these men want the same thing. “They all want their old penises back,” Evriviades confesses. “That much is distinctly clear. Some things, no matter how much we learn or push the science, are beyond even our reach.”
