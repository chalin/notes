Our generation grew up admiring [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft). The sound of the [Windows95](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHa7ZC6Z0) or [Windows98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tajDxBaPBBM) login screen generates all kinds of memories and emotions for us. Windows was our window to the world before we could access the Internet. This was Microsoft of the 1990s. Unfortunately, Microsoft went through some tough times at the beginning of the century before going through a strategic and cultural transformation in 2014 and afterward. This transformation is a story to be told, and I will try to capture it here based on my time at Microsoft (2014–2018) and my time at [Stanford Business](https://medium.com/u/3f137ffa211c?source=post_page-----f97d8148687b----------------------) School ([GSB](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/)) analyzing their transformation.

Last week, I had the honor of teaching [a HBS case](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=53450) on Microsoft’s transformation at [Stanford Business](https://medium.com/u/3f137ffa211c?source=post_page-----f97d8148687b----------------------), as part of the OB.219 core class of Organizational Design by professor [Adina Sterling](https://medium.com/u/aecd4aafefe5?source=post_page-----f97d8148687b----------------------). The questions & comments were very insightful that made me appreciate the transformation even more. This is one reason why I wanted to capture the discussion here (Thank you, Adina and MSxers’20).

## Why Transform?

Pre-2012, Microsoft’s main revenue was generated from the high-margin products like Windows, Office and the business tools. At that time, Microsoft was by no means a small company: ~$224B market cap and ~122K employees. The internal culture at that time was focused on efficiency with no room for mistakes and very internally competitive. The notorious [stack ranking system for performance review and promotion](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-performance-reviews-how-they-work-under-satya-nadella-2019-8) introduced a lot of internal competition within the same team, across teams and between organizations. Experimenting, taking risks and making mistakes were not possible there. This culture was efficient in a “*Windows-first*” world. For example, everyone cared about the [*MTTF*](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8281/mean-time-to-failure-mttf) (Mean-Time-To-Failure), measuring the time between fixes for windows or office. Because software bugs-once the software shipped- are very costly to fix (we are talking about an era when fixes were being distributed using floppy disks and later, CDs then slow internet), and occasionally Windows bugs news made it to the headlines of the newspapers and impacted Microsoft’s stock price. Therefore, the cost of a mistake is very high and the *MTTF* has to be long. As a result, the internal culture favored the safe bet and preferred to not take any risk in their development approach without extensive multi-year testing to reduce any mistakes.

However, the PC industry was diminishing and the competitive landscape was changing, with Google, Amazon, Apple, and Salesforce competing with Microsoft for the same customers. For Microsoft, continuing to operate in this market without a strategic change would mean a diminishing market cap and, possibly, a slow death. It would also mean a brain-drain of the best engineering minds from Microsoft to the competition. That is especially true as the competition started setting up offices in the Seattle area and coming after Microsoft engineering talent. As a result, Microsoft had to evolve despite the *understandable* push back from the public markets. The public market push back was natural after all. Evolution is risky because it requires increasing operating costs and reduced dividends, something that is never liked by the public markets. The market would rather prefer to keep the cash cows and the high margins of Microsoft products. For a publically traded company like Microsoft, evolution is basically a bet on the future that may or may not pay off. After all, only 1 in 3 companies is successful in this kind of transformation. Nonetheless, they decided to take the risk.

## How to go about it?

A Growth Mindset is what Microsoft adopted to evolve its strategy and its business in 2014. [Carol S. Dweck](https://g.co/kgs/yG7e26), the psychology professor at Stanford [wrote her famous book](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/1400062756/ref=asc_df_1400062756/) on the difference between a growth and a fixed mindset, which was exactly what Microsoft needed. They decided to take the risk, to go for a new strategy by building the emerging cloud business. This new strategy required a change in the culture to a new mindset, which [Kathleen Hogan](https://g.co/kgs/uwZweA), the new Microsoft Chief People Officer, led very skillfully (Kathleen is a fellow GSBer).

In this new “*Cloud-First*” world, the company’s culture and mindset needed to evolve. Having said that, changing the mindset of 122,000+ employees (some of whom has spent 25+ yrs at Microsoft and are at leadership positions) is not a trivial task.

Using various cultural levers, such as people processes, artifacts, language, rituals and most importantly, compensation structure, facilitated the process though. Using “One-Microsoft” as a new slogan to encourage collaboration between and within teams, encouraging risk-taking and celebrating mistakes are some examples. Changing the [performance and promotion system](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-performance-reviews-how-they-work-under-satya-nadella-2019-8) to encourage collaboration, the co-existence between the open-source world and Microsoft's technologies (by the acquisition of GitHub) and by avoiding the “not-made-here” mentality were all some tools that helped steer the culture to a new growth mindset. MTTF was encouraged to be short, agile software development methods were adopted given that updates are now constantly rolling out in a cloud environment and that fixes are cheaper and continuously shipped throughout the day.

For me, there were two incidents that signaled the change in Microsoft culture and which stuck with me until today. The first was [when Satya, the new CEO, misspoke at the 2014 Grace Hopper Conference](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2014/10/10/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-apologizes-for-comments-on-womens-pay/#477ee5046d2b). I was in the audience at the conference. At that time, I had a Microsoft job offer on the table that I was leaning toward declining. How he handled the failure, his public apology and his commitment to invest more in women technologists as well as seeing him spending several hours on the exhibition floor at GHC’14, made a whole lot of difference for me. I decided to take the job with Microsoft there and then.

The second incidence for me was when I saw a fixed/growth mindest signs (similar to the one in the picture) getting installed in every meeting room in the HQ buildings. While, in the beginning, it was an office joke, the engineers started slowly to take it more seriously and started adopting the new growth mindset. Having said that, it was a painful process internally, as some teams were evolving faster than others. Getting business done and decisions made were sometimes like pulling teeth during that transitional time. However, I could tell there was a change happening in the company culture overall.

## Microsoft Today

Fast forward to today, Microsoft successfully navigated to a new era with the *Cloud-first *strategy and with a growth mindset culture. It more-than quadrupled its market-cap to $1 Trillion and its stock prices surged to ~$140 (from $20–$30 in 2012). Today, Microsoft is one of the unique successful examples of strategy and cultural transformations of a public large-scale company. Microsoft transformation offers many lessons to other executives of public and private companies to learn from and to build upon.
