I research [cybersecurity#cybersecurity (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/cybersecurity) for a living. I’ve been working in this [industry#industry (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/industry) for about ten years now. A layperson, such as any of my non-infosec friends, would assume everything that I do is super secure. If someone is a [medical#medical (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/medical) doctor, surely they live a very healthy lifestyle! A professional chef always prepares delicious gourmet meals from scratch at home! A fashion stylist would never be caught dead in sweatpants! Unfortunately, the real world is more complicated than that. Many medical doctors chain smoke. Many professional chefs microwave factory-made frozen dinners at home because they spend a hundred grueling hours per week in their professional kitchen and they’re exhausted. Some fashion stylists wear ugly sweatpants at home because wearing this season’s latest ready-to-wear is too cumbersome for a day of Netflix binge-watching. I too have had some bad habits regarding my own personal use of computer technology.

For years, I used complex [passwords#passwords (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/passwords) but I reused the same complex [password#password (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/password) for many different online [services#services (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/services) and other such [authentication#authentication (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/authentication) vectors. It’s a real hassle to try to remember a different complex password for each [service#service (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/service) you [log#log (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/log) into, and at least a complex password is tough to crack. But I spent years [reporting#reporting (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/reporting)  [data breaches#data breaches (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/data-breaches) until I realized that we’re all [pwned#pwned (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/pwned), several times, and we will continue to be pwned, multiple times. ([Thank you Troy Hunt](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).) Pretty much every single thing we log into will be subject to data [breaches#breaches (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/breaches) which put our passwords into the hands of cyber attackers. Fortunately more and more of these services store passwords as [ciphertext#ciphertext (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/ciphertext) with hashes. But those can be [cracked#cracked (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/cracked) too (especially weak [hashes#hashes (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/hashes) like SHA-1), and the [best practice#best practice (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/best-practice-1) is to use a different complex password for each of our accounts, so one [breached#breached (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/breached) password doesn’t affect multiple accounts. That would have been a Herculean expectation of our imperfect [human#human (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/human-1) brains until [password managers#password managers (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/password-managers) became a thing. But in the past few years I have broken that bad habit. All of my accounts now have unique complex passwords, and the [password manager#password manager (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/password-manager) built into [Google Chrome#Google Chrome (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/google-chrome) helped to make that easy for all of my [web#web (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/web) services. I use [Chrome#Chrome (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/chrome) on my [phone#phone (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/phone) too, everything syncs through my [Google#Google (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/google-2) account, so it’s all easy. And when I need a new complex password I can have Chrome generate one for me.

Which unfortunately segues into my other bad habit. That bad habit is Google Chrome.

All of the major [tech#tech (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/tech) behemoths that have proprietary technology engage in some sins due to the vicious nature of capitalism. They’ve gotta make money somehow! [Apple#Apple (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/apple) sells overpriced [devices#devices (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/devices) that are made to break or become subject to planned obsolescence within two years of buying, plus they consider their products to be their property even after you buy them. But you’ll keep buying iPhones and Macbooks because you get [locked#locked (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/locked) into their service ecosystem. [Microsoft#Microsoft (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/microsoft) makes software, some of it is proprietary [freeware#freeware (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/freeware), some of it is pricey software-as-a-service. They’ll also [lock#lock (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/lock) you into their service [ecosystem#ecosystem (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/ecosystem), and engage in some datamining on their [Windows 10#Windows 10 (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/windows-10) and [Xbox#Xbox (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/xbox) One endpoints. Google is arguably one of the worst. Those of us who are locked into their Gmail/YouTube/Google Services ecosystem find buying [Android#Android (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/android) phones to be more convenient. Google allows OEMs to use Android free-of-charge, and they’ll also provide support and [updates#updates (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/updates) for no extra charge. But when you buy an [iPhone#iPhone (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/iphone), you’ve given Apple $1,000 or more for your device. Google makes no money directly from your purchase of an [Android phone#Android phone (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/android-phone) made by [Samsung#Samsung (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/samsung), [Sony#Sony (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/sony), [LG#LG (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/lg), Motorola, or whatever. They make money mainly from the datamining they can do on your Android endpoint. The use of [Gmail#Gmail (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/gmail), Chrome, and many other [Google apps#Google apps (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/google-apps) increases the datamining surface ever more. [Desktop#Desktop (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/desktop) PCs running [macOS#macOS (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/macos), [Windows,#Windows, (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/windows-2004)  [Linux#Linux (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/linux), [Chrome OS#Chrome OS (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/chrome-os), or [UNIX#UNIX (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/unix) also all can [install#install (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/install) their native versions of the Chrome or [Chromium#Chromium (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/chromium) web browser. As can iOS in the [mobile#mobile (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/mobile) space. When you do so, Google is datamining you too, even if you use an iPhone and a [Windows#Windows (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/windows) PC. Sure Apple is probably overcharging you for buying and repairing their iPhones and Macbooks, but at least they’re a lot more respectful of your [data privacy#data privacy (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/data-privacy), because datamining isn’t really part of their revenue model.

I’ve been fully locked into Google’s ecosystem since at least 2007, when I signed up for my Gmail account. Ever since they launched Chrome and bought and launched Android, I’ve been using those platforms too. I run a [Linux distro#Linux distro (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/linux-distro) on my [PC#PC (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/pc) that’s more respectful for my user [rights#rights (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/rights) and [privacy#privacy (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/privacy) than Windows would be. And I [stopped#stopped (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/stopped) using [Facebook#Facebook (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/facebook) in 2012. But Microsoft and Facebook’s inability to datamine me is all for naught when Google knows my every move. Google knows my [emails#emails (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/emails), Google knows where I go with my Android phone, Google knows which restaurants and shops I like. I replaced [Google Search#Google Search (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/google-search) with Duck Duck Go on my desktop and mobile endpoints. But I’ve still been using Chrome and Chromium all this time, so the joke’s on me! I have so many passwords saved in my Chrome password manager! Ugh!

Well, I am a sucker no more. [Mozilla#Mozilla (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/mozilla)  [Firefox#Firefox (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/firefox) has improved leaps and bounds since they started competing with Chrome well over a decade ago. Importing my bookmarks and passwords from Chrome and Chromium is a bit of a task, but I managed to do it. It’s all worth it because Firefox is an [opensource#opensource (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/opensource), privacy-minded platform. As of today, I’m just using Firefox on my Linux PC and my Android phone. Good riddance.

[From the Mozilla blog on June 4th](https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/firefox-data-privacy-promise/):

I will be the first to admit that I’m on the [payroll#payroll (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/payroll) of multiple [tech companies#tech companies (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/tech-companies), including AT&T, BlackBerry, and Venafi. I openly admit to doing well paid sponsored content for companies like HP. I must accept those sorts of things, they pay my bills and allow me to live well while making cybersecurity blogging my day job. I strongly believe that using [antivirus software#antivirus software (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/antivirus-software), [SIEM#SIEM (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/siem), and machine [identity management#identity management (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/identity-management) is a good thing. But when I say so, I absolutely am biased. But I have never been paid by either Google or Mozilla. My endorsement of Firefox in this [post#post (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/post) is pure and untainted. I’ve been using the [Tor Browser#Tor Browser (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/tor-browser) for a long time now in order to access the [Dark Web#Dark Web (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/dark-web) for my work. But there’s a reason why the [Tor#Tor (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/tor)  [Browser#Browser (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/browser) is a fork of Firefox and not Chrome. That’s because when you’re building a strictly security and privacy-minded browser, Firefox is the most natural place for [developers#developers (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/developers) to work from. It’s obvious that I should be using the Tor Browser and vanilla Firefox for all of my clearnet web use too.

I’ve been aware of the privacy problems with Chrome for at least a few years now. But I’ve finally kicked Chrome for good. Google will continue to [track#track (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/track) and datamine me through Android, Gmail, [Google Docs#Google Docs (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/google-docs), Google Keep, [Google Drive#Google Drive (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/google-drive), and YouTube. I will still send Google $30 per year or so for my extra [storage#storage (Tag)](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/storage) on their cloud. But by switching to Duck Duck Go and Firefox, I’ve at least reduced my datamining surface for Google a little bit.

[This guide on TechLogon](https://techlogon.com/how-to-import-google-chrome-data-into-firefox/) helped me move my bookmarks and passwords to Firefox from Chrome.

Good riddance, Chrome. I won’t miss you now.
