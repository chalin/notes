On Imposter Syndrome

Here's a response to that blurb, which resonated with me, especially this: "Underachieve on purpose (personal battles with me vs my parents)".

Thank you for sharing this.

Also thanks for letting me know about this group!

I've had low grade impostor syndrome ever since college.  I think it was driven by the fairly classic story of my childhood, which I suspect many of you can relate to:

- Cruise through private and public schools, mostly bored.
- AP classes feel normal, normal classes are torture.
- Underachieve on purpose (personal battles with me vs my parents).
- Pick up just about everything too easily.
- Get into a very very good University after sneaking in the backdoor as a CC transfer.
    - Immediately realize for the first time in my life that I'm not actually very smart at all, I've just never been put head to head against people who are *actually* brilliant.
    - Encounter massive, soul-crushing struggles to understand educational materials for the first time in my life....at 18 I start the process of learning something I should have been learning all my life:  How to succeed at something that does NOT come easily to you.

It stayed like that, in steady state, until I came to Google.

Something about getting this job, when i was *sure* that I would be rejected....its taken low grade impostor syndrome and turned it into a raging meltdown that threatens my career, my happiness, and my health.
