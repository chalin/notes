Description

A handful of people working at a handful of tech companies steer the thoughts of billions of people every day, says design thinker Tristan Harris.

Harris shares how these companies prey on our psychology for their own profit and calls for a design renaissance in which our tech instead encourages us to live out the timeline we want.
