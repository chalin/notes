Ask HN: How to get started developing with FPGA? 243 points | by jason_slack 1 day ago [ vote ] 82 comments [+] Add Comment phendrenad2 1 day ago reply 1) FPGAs are used for low-level stuff (high-speed digital logic) and high-level stuff (accelerating algorithms). It sounds like you're only interested in the latter. You can ignore any tutorials that go into Verilog/VHDL or low-level logic design. 2) The two major FPGA manufacturers are Intel and Xilinx. Each has their own tools. The tools are very different. You should pick one (flip a coin) and stick with it, at least starting out.
