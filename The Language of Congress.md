An [Einstein AI](https://einstein.ai/) Experiment

We fed thousands of Congressional tweets to a machine learning algorithm in order to recognize political issues. We'll keep doing this every day of the 116th congress, from January 3 2019 through January 3, 2021.

These are the topics that dominate members  of Congress’ **public discourse**—the issues they discuss (and don’t discuss). We’ve visualized data [nationally](), for [members of Congress](https://congress.pudding.cool/person/SenateMajLdr), and [issues](https://congress.pudding.cool/issue/Health/year).

## Method

### Background

The impetus for this project began with a simple question: for issues that occupy the public discourse—e.g., gun control, employment, immigration—how often are elected officials speaking out on the topic publicly? Climate change, for example, may be one of the most important topics facing our future. But how often is it mentioned by members of Congress? Is it important enough for them to comment?

We began looking for answers by starting with Twitter (though members of Congress’ statements are also found in official releases, news interviews, speeches, House floor, etc.).

### Approach

We sought to use an out-of-the-box machine learning model to make predictions—one that could run in real-time and update each day.

This analysis builds on new deep learning, advanced language models. For this project, we used the [Einstein Intent API](https://einstein.ai/products/custom-intent) to train a model to predict what issue a member of Congress’ tweet pertains to. This model was trained on approximately 3,000 tweets that were manually classified into issues by our team (i.e., a training process). Afterwards, it develops a probability that a tweet falls within a given issue.

[A prior study](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5560&context=etd) found that, depending on the state, between 25 and 75 percent of Congress's tweets aren't about policy issues at all. Similarly, our model found that about half of the tweets didn't fit into any of the policy categories it was trained on. We left those tweets, which include things like holiday wishes and town hall announcements, out of our analysis.

Tweets were obtained via the Twitter API for all current members of Congress with active Twitter accounts.

### Existing Work

Much work has been done on automated tweet classification. For example, In 2013, researchers [classified 2 million fitness tweets using a model](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3771015/).

In 2015, MIT Media Lab created [Electome](https://www.media.mit.edu/videos/sm-electome-2017-01-31/?autoplay=true), a tool that categorized hundreds of millions of tweets into those about the US election, and further sub-categorizing those into political issues, such as trade, guns, and women’s rights.

When it comes to elected officials, studies seek to improve automated tweet classification based on political agenda and issues. These build on the existing automated classifiers that have been employed on elected officials’ speeches, [campaign communications](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221613448_Content-driven_detection_of_campaigns_in_social_media), [legislative](https://www.comparativeagendas.net/)  [bills](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1146660). In 2018, The Pudding also [categorized 500,000 House speeches](https://pudding.cool/2018/07/women-in-congress/) into 75 topics using a probabilistic machine learning model (LDA), visualizing the breakdown of speeches, by policy, for men and women.

In 2009, researchers manually coded 6,000 tweets from Congress [to understand](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.158.9947&rep=rep1&type=pdf) how they used to platform to communicate.

In 2014, researchers at the Illinois Institute of Technology classified tweets from Congress in [What’s Congress Doing on Twitter?](https://www.libbyh.com/files/Hemphill_Otterbacher_Shapiro_2013_Whats_Congress_Doing_on_Twitter.pdf), a paper that categorized tweets based on speech acts (e.g., narrating, positioning, thanking, etc.). A similar paper, also in 2014, [analyzed](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261913309_Twitter_Style_An_Analysis_of_How_House_Candidates_Used_Twitter_in_Their_2012_Campaigns) members of Congress’s use of Twitter in how tweets spread across attacks, campaigning, issues, and presidential support.

In 2015, Sheetal Kaul categorized state senate tweets into political agenda categories and also a binary of “has agenda” and “does not have agenda,” finding a SVM with linear kernel model yielded the best results.

In 2016, Rihui Li [classified elected officials tweets](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0004/b9b06d2ae19edcc02c60492472159972061a.pdf) into 21 categories and found success with a Convolutional Neural Networks for short text categorization, achieving 77.34% accuracy.

In 2018, researchers at the University of Albany [classified](http://blogs.oii.ox.ac.uk/policy/wp-content/uploads/sites/77/2018/08/IPP2018-DePaula.pdf) the EPA’s political agenda tweets under the Trump and Obama administration.

In March 2019, researchers at the University of Michigan, led by Libby Hemphill, [similarly trained a supervised machine learning classifier](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/148323/Rhetorical%20Agenda%20for%20MPSA%202019.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) and labeled 1.5 million tweets and analyzed what influenced to policy areas members of Congress tweeted about. The team visualized frequencies of each topic from 2017-2018, and broke down the results by gender, party, and chamber.

In July 2019, after this project commenced, researchers at University of Southern California and New York University sought [to understand](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/who-leads-who-follows-measuring-issue-attention-and-agenda-setting-by-legislators-and-the-mass-public-using-social-media-data/D855849CE288A241529E9EC2E4FBD3A8) the relationship between members of Congress and the public when it comes to paying attention to issues. The team used an LDA model to extract 100 topics discussed by legislators, followed by a vector autoregression to see whether political agendas shift due to public shifts. The data is available in [an interactive site](http://pablobarbera.com/congress-lda/topic-53.html), visualizing topic usage over time and sample tweets from members of Congress.

In the realm of journalism, a number of projects have also categorized tweets from elected officials to understand specific candidate’s or official’s political stance.

In January 2018, Peter Aldhous, for Buzzfeed, [analyzed the issues](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/trump-twitter-wars?bfsource=relatedmanual) tweeted by President Trump, Republicans, and Democrats using common word pairings.

In June 2019, Allison McCartney [analyzed the tweets](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-democratic-presidential-candidate-policies/) of the 2020 Democratic Candidates, by political issue, for Bloomberg, producing stream graphs across the 13 categories by candidate.

Also in June 2019, Kevin Schaul and Kevin Uhrmacher analyzed [The issues 2020 Democrats are running on, according to their social media](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/priorities-issues/) for The Washington Post, categorizing 9,200 social media posts into 8 issues.

There are two notable projects that are automatically surfacing tweets from Members of Congress and elected officials. Since 2008, [TweetCongress](http://www.tweetcongress.org/) is a simple interface to quickly see what members of Congress communicated on Twitter, as well as search for keywords and hashtags across accounts. [Categorized Tweets](https://www.categorizedtweets.com/) surfaces tweets from a broader set of elected officials, candidates, as well as political influencers. Similar to other projects, the site automatically classifies tweets into 9 categories and visualizes a breakdown of each person’s tweets.

### Support

This project is supported financially by Salesforce's machine learning team, who lent both their expertise and, importantly, open access to their AI tools (and millions of API calls).
