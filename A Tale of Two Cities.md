Exploring what characterizes the neighborhoods of

New York
Maple Leaf
Seattle

We often speak of cities as singular entities, but in truth, they are amalgamations of neighborhoods: when I say I live in New York, what I really mean is that I live in Bedford-Stuyvesant, work from an office in Chelsea, and spend my weekends in Bushwick. My colleague Amber, meanwhile, is a resident of Seattle, but it’s more accurate to say that she lives and works in Belltown, and spends her free time exploring the green spaces in Broadmoor, Magnolia and Green Lake.

Below, Amber and I attempt to describe our cities through their neighborhoods. To do so, we examined the businesses that were more common within a neighborhood than in the city as a whole (e.g., if personal shoppers made up 1% of businesses in a city while comprising 10% of the businesses in a neighborhood, we deemed them to be uniquely representative of that neighborhood, since they were 10 times as likely to occur in a neighborhood than in the city).

We often describe [our](https://pudding.cool/2018/03/neighborhoods/%E2%80%9Dhttps://pudding.cool/2018/02/stand-up/%E2%80%9D)  [essays](https://pudding.cool/2018/03/neighborhoods/%E2%80%9Dhttps://pudding.cool/2017/09/hip-hop-words/%E2%80%9D) as data-driven “love letters” to particular topics. This story is our love letter to the places that we call home.

As told by The Pudding’s resident Seattleite, [Amber Thomas](https://twitter.com/ProQuesAsker).

I used to imagine that one day I’d choose my next travel destination by closing my eyes and blindly pointing to a spot on a map. Our decision to move to Seattle wasn’t quite so haphazard, but not by much. Neither my boyfriend nor I had been to the city. Neither of us had jobs, apartments, or family there. We were just looking for a change from our Orlando lives and thought that Seattle sounded like a place that was just our speed.

Luckily, we fell in love with the city almost instantly. Somewhere between the trees, the coast, the mountains, and the people, we found ourselves right at home. We settled in Belltown, a little neighborhood right near the tourist-y part of the city, and although it may not be everyone’s cup of (tea) coffee, we love it. We said goodbye to our cars and hello to walking shoes and bus passes. Contrary to public opinion, our days are more green and lovely than gray and dreary. And in true Seattle fashion, [our dog](https://www.instagram.com/sherlockthedox/) comes with us on every adventure.

”Oh, you *have* to see the Fremont troll!” I had no idea what the “Fremont troll” was, but *everyone* told me that I just *had* to see it when I got to Seattle. As it turns out, it’s an enormous [statue of a troll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Troll) beneath the Aurora bridge, crushing a Volkswagen beetle. The statue itself is endearing and quirky and it turns out that Fremont, the neighborhood that it calls home, is no different. The area’s unofficial motto is *“De Libertas Quirkas”* or “Freedom to be Peculiar” and I couldn’t think of a phrase more fitting. The scene is artistic and entertaining and our analyses suggest that the neighborhood is home to an unusually high number of massage, skin care, and acupuncture businesses. For what it’s worth, every Seattleite I’ve mentioned this to laughs and says “That sounds about right”. You do you, Fremont.

Capitol Hill

1. Cocktail Bars

2. Bars

3. Apartments

4. New American Food

5. Real Estate Agents

The first time I ventured to “Cap Hill”, I decided to walk there. But in Seattle, when a neighborhood has “hill” in the name, they generally aren’t kidding. My muscles burned as I made my way up the unbelievably steep incline but the views at the top were worth the effort. The streets were busy in a way that most of Seattle is not, but looking a bit closer, some people were actually dancing, albeit slightly awkwardly, in the middle of the walkway. There were [bronze shoe prints and arrows](https://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/The-story-behind-the-steps-in-the-sidewalk-1200133.php?source=mypi) adorning the sidewalk on Broadway, teaching passersby how to rumba, foxtrot, tango, or “obeebo”, a made-up dance that happens when you walk directly towards someone on the street and both awkwardly try to move out of one another’s way. The sidewalk dancing is entertaining both during the day, with people genuinely trying to learn the steps, and in the evenings, when people have left the nearby bars and nightclubs and take their alcohol-enhanced dancing skills to the streets. Rainbows are also visible throughout the area, as Capitol Hill is home to Seattle’s largest LGBTQ community. “Love is Love” signs hang in nearly every shop window and you literally walk across [rainbows](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/colorful-crosswalks-celebrate-gay-pride-in-seattle/) when passing through intersections.

Roosevelt

1. Family Doctor

2. Physicians

3. Reiki

Moving to Seattle marked a career-transition for me. I was leaving behind the world of marine biology and I was anxious about the change. So, before our apartment was even furnished, I trekked to the city’s Roosevelt neighborhood for a [data visualization meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Viz-Jam-Sessions/events/248150943/). It was held in a [coffee shop](http://www.waywardcoffee.com/) whose slogan was “an independent coffee haven for geeks”, so, naturally, I felt right at home. As I sat at the table, sipping a drink named after some Sci-Fi character or another, I had no idea what neighborhood I was in. So, even though our data suggests that most people may visit Roosevelt for some type of medical care, I will always think of that area as a place for new beginnings.
