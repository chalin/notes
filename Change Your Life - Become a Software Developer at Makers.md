#### Funmi Adewodu, Yoyo Wallet

“The​ ​whole​ ​Makers​ ​experience​ ​was​ ​amazing​ ​and​ ​completely​ ​life​ ​changing.​ ​It​ ​has been​ ​the​ ​best​ ​form​ ​of​ ​education​ ​I​ ​have​ ​ever​ ​been​ ​through.​ The emotional​ ​intelligence​ ​curriculum​ ​at​ ​Makers​ ​also​ ​gave​ ​me​ ​a​ ​sense​ ​of​ ​self​-​awareness that​ ​I​ ​never​ ​really​ ​had​ ​before​ ​the​ ​course.”

#### Chris Harrop, Jigsaw XYZ

“Since Makers, I’m happier. I’ve gained a tangible skill that means I don’t just have a job, I am what I do and I’m proud to do it. I owe a great deal to my fellow Makers Alumni and everyone who supported me through the course. Life-changing is a cliched term but this is a truly transformative course.”

#### Jennifer Shepherd, Financial Times

“There’s been a lot to learn but I’m already impressed that I’m encountering challenges, working to overcome them and moving on to the next area quite quickly. It can be daunting. I like that the Makers ethos is about learning plenty, getting stuck, working out how to get unstuck and then working hard to move forward.” [Read More](https://makers.tech/success-story-jennifer-shepherd)

#### Dominic Vernon, Deloitte UK

“At Makers, you’re encouraged to be active in your own learning rather than have it passively given to you. To learn a language you need to be immersed in a culture… you can’t just do it three hours a week. You need to really get to grips with it. You need to just get stuck in and not be afraid to get things rolling or to try do things differently.”

#### Dania Mah, Freelancer

“Makers provided an incredible 12 weeks that kickstarted me to dig into tech and find its fit with the world of design. It was a personalized experience that builds the developer’s habits of being constantly curious and focused on your learning. It was a crazy roller coaster I thought I wouldn’t get through but Makers teaches you that any situation will always work out no matter how impossible things may seem.”

#### Gabriela Budeanu, Jigsaw XYZ

“Until changing careers, I felt like my work wasn’t making a big impact on the world. I am now very excited that I can contribute and be part of all the big future changes that technology will bring to our lives. Makers was challenging and very intense, but at at the same time fantastic and life changing.”

#### Peter Johnstone, Cleo AI

“Makers exists for a reason: that there are not enough junior developers out there. That makes you in demand. And on top of that, they have a fabulous careers team, who will be alongside you throughout the process.”

#### Christopher Ly, Spektrix

“There aren’t  enough words to describe the experience. The course, the camaraderie within your cohort, the support you get from the careers team – the experience in its entirety was exhilarating. There was never a day where I didn’t want to come in and spend time among my peers.”
