#  A Simple Cloud IDE

####  Haiku is a desktop terminal app that runs commands on a cloud instance.

#  How It Works

Setting up developer environments is painful. With Haiku, you can use predefined machine images to start coding on a Rails, Node, or Deep Learning stack without any of the hassle.

For resource intensive projects, you can configure your instance for whatever CPU, GPU, or memory resources you need with one click. Haiku takes care of creating, starting, and stopping your instances.

Haiku is a fully featured terminal app and supports all terminal-based editors like vim and emacs. It runs as a desktop application with none of the clunky user experience of a browser-based IDE.
