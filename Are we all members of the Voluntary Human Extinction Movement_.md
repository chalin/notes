Are we all members of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement?

The desire for humanity to go extinct seems crazy, but it may also be the dominant ideology of our time.

The other week, the *Guardian* Experience column, which I love because it’s one of very few places you can read about people being [eaten by hippos in a broadsheet newspaper](https://theoutline.com/post/6785/why-i-love-guardian-experience-essays?zd=3&zi=xe7a7ycg), published an essay by a retired supply teacher called Les Knight, who has dedicated his life to campaigning for the extinction of the human race (the title of the article is, fittingly, [“Experience: I campaign for the extinction of the human race”](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/10/i-campaign-for-the-extinction-of-the-human-race-les-knight)).

“My journey to advocating for voluntary human extinction began at school,” Knight writes. As he remembers it, everywhere, throughout his childhood, seemed like it was getting too full up with *people*:

*> “I was born in the post-war baby boom in a small desert town in Oregon... There were more new students than the elementary school could cope with, so classes overflowed into churches. In my fourth year, we were taught in the county library; people checked out books as we learned. High school was the same: the cafeteria had to be converted into classrooms. There just weren’t enough resources.”*

After a stint in the army, Knight started reading books about how overpopulation would imminently lead to food shortages and famine (a thesis soon disproved, of course, by the [Third Agricultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution)). He joined a movement called Zero Population Growth, which wanted every couple to stop breeding after they'd had two children, and at 25 he secured himself a free vasectomy by letting a student doctor use him for practice. But eventually, Knight decided that simply *limiting* human population growth would never be enough: even a much smaller human population would continue to crowd and defile everywhere it occupied. And so, in the late 1980s, after settling in Portland, Oregon, Knight founded the [Voluntary Human Extinction Movement](http://vhemt.org/). “Our message is simple,” he claims, “we encourage people to stop procreating so the biosphere might return to its former glory, and everyone already here will be able to live life more abundantly.”

> The message of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement might rightly be claimed as the dominant ideology of our society and culture.

The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement has never commanded anything close to mass appeal. Their main output is a newsletter called *These Exit Times*, which may have as few as 230 subscribers — although, to its credit, it does apparently feature a cartoon strip about a [voluntarily childless woman raising a bonobo](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/live-long-and-die-out-stephen-jarvis-encounters-the-voluntary-human-extinction-movement-1372200.html).

To many, Knight's ideas must seem strange, even crazy; in opposition to everything humanity *ought* to hold dear. But on another — perhaps even more accurate — level, the message of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement might rightly be claimed as the dominant ideology of our society and culture.

Knight himself has claimed that his movement consists of “anyone who supports the idea” of [humanity going extinct](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/1998/12/17/sui-genocide). And it is interesting to consider what this “support” might plausibly consist of.

For one thing, we could count anyone, at any point in human history, regardless of VHEM membership, who subscribes in some way to Knight's views. Thus the Medieval Cathars, who believed that reproduction was a sin, were unwitting members of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement. So too are any followers of the South African philosopher David Benatar, whose “anti-natalism” is premised on the intuition that it is always bad to bring a new conscious being into existence, since with existence comes the capacity to suffer. Some members of the r/childfree subreddit seem to believe that others should stop having children because it makes it more difficult for them [personally to win costume contests](https://twitter.com/dannolan/status/1207233638317748226?lang=en).

Knight also appears to be willing to claim as allies people who remain voluntarily childless as a result of [concerns over climate change](https://theoutline.com/post/7925/having-babies-climate-change-birthstrike?utm_source=contributor_pages&zd=1&zi=6xmnipif) — although not wanting to have kids because you're worried about your kids’ carbon footprint, or the quality of life they might very well be denied in a rapidly warming world, is not the same as thinking it might be better if the whole human race went extinct. More plausibly, it seems motivated by a concern that the planet should be as liveable as possible for those who *do* happen to be born.

But then in addition to these people, we should probably also think to include those whose actions — regardless of what they say, or think, they are doing — *in fact* seem to be helping to bring the extinction of the human race about. (Some theoretical grounding here might be provided by Robert Pippin’s Hegelian, “expressivist” theory of intention, on which actions “disclose what an agent takes herself to be doing” — often, indeed, to the agent herself).

> Perhaps non-existence, in all its finality, has a certain sort of libidinal appeal

And into this category of by-fruits-knowners would fall rather a lot of people, especially those people currently in power. Take the Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison. Morrison might not *explicitly* want his country to be reduced to a permanently blazing apocalyptic hell, he might not make speeches openly in favor of bringing death and punishment to Australia. But his actions, and those of his government, are in fact working to make Australia’s [complete devastation by climate change a lot more likely](https://theoutline.com/post/8508/australia-fires-climate-change-response?zd=1&zi=x4ufahiz). It is a similar situation with Brazil President Jair Bolsanaro, and his enthusiasm for burning down his country’s rainforests.

But the very powerful don’t only help accelerate the destruction of the planet/the human species by being cartoonish goons or villains. They also do it much more quietly, by producing structures which force us into “choices” that necessarily make us complicit with the death-spiral: driving cars; eating food farmed on land grown on cleared rainforests, or in monocultures that kill bees; even just going online. As Pippinian, expressivists agents — do even we want everything to die?

So why would anyone, powerful or otherwise, want all conscious life to go extinct? It's worth considering what the death of all conscious life on earth would actually mean. Without anyone or anything left to experience it, the planet will — yes — persist. But not *as* the Earth — not *as* a planet; for there will be nothing left to conceptualize it as such. Non-existence beckons.

And perhaps non-existence, in all its finality, has a certain sort of libidinal appeal. Freud, for instance, identified the “death drive” (or “death instincts”) as being one of the fundamental forces shaping our psychic lives — aside from the life instincts (towards survival, sexual pleasure, and so forth), we all share the “urge inherent in organic life to restore an earlier state of things”, i.e. non-existence. In a sense, then, “the aim of all life is death.” Which can be fine, since any living species eventually has older generations die off — but only if the death instincts are properly balanced with their opposites. If the death instincts ever won out completely, there would be no more life left to speak of (interestingly, Freud speaks of the death drive as a fundamentally “conservative” drive, which seems about right). Knight's own essay speaks of his desire for a less cluttered world, where everything beautiful beyond human life could finally thrive — his own life-instincts seem to have been projected onto the non-human.

Maybe all of this is in fact motivated not by the death drive, but its opposite. Knight claims he wants all human beings now living to live life to its fullest while voluntarily choosing to wind down the human race. In a way then he doesn't really want to eliminate human life as such: What he actually wants to eliminate are future human *generations*.

And perhaps that's what the powers-that-be want as well. Knight is a Baby Boomer: a generation the members of whom are notorious for having material interests often starkly opposed to those of their children. What if endless, consequence-free life could be secured for all Boomers, with no pesky shape-of-things-to-come emerging to oppose it? (Was this not, in a sense, the desire behind that paradigmatic work of Boomer philosophy, Francis Fukuyama’s *The End of History*?) Perhaps something like the sterile, polymorphically perverse utopia imagined by Michael Moorcock in his series *The Dancers at the End of Time*. Or the “Grand Hotel Abyss” Georg Lukács described in order to zing his Frankfurt School opponents, who stayed to live comfortably complaining about the capitalist West rather than try and build communism in the East:

*> “a beautiful hotel, equipped with every comfort, on the edge of an abyss, of nothingness, of absurdity. And the daily contemplation of the abyss between excellent meals or artistic entertainments, can only heighten the enjoyment of the subtle comforts offered.”*

What if climate disaster is simply a failed attempt to secure this nihilist utopia — the elimination of future generations, without yet having secured eternal life for those now living?

When one considers the extreme electoral polarization between [old and young people in the UK](https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/17/election-results-reveal-massive-divide-old-young-voters-11920781/) or the [US](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3651), it is possible to conclude with a sort of grim hope that the death spiral can only last so long, that eventually socialism will become the inevitable norm. But just as not all Boomers are selfish, pampered landlords who blundered their way through life riding a wave of extreme historical luck, it would seem strange to think of this utopic nihilism as being purely generational: if nothing else, Millennials were raised in a wholly Boomerfied world, and so we carry the seed of this nihilism with us.

In years to come, how might utopic nihilism continue to manifest? As forests blaze, icebergs melt, and oceans rise, will it continue to be a viable electoral force? What might the political settlement of the future be — between people who actively *want* the human species, now perilously threatened, to be some sort of ongoing concern, and people who would be perfectly happy for it to end with themselves, just so long as they can have some fun right now?

Trump’s farcical plan for “peace” in the Middle East

Somewhat lost in the noise of the past week, during which the Republican Senate acquitted Donald Trump of the various crimes that most of them had already publicly conceded he’d committed and the Democratic Party apparatus in Iowa was [credibly accused](https://theoutline.com/post/8640/iowa-caucus-conspiracy-theory) of subverting its own caucuses in order to steal a victory from Bernie Sanders, was the fact that the week prior, the Trump administration had released its [plan for Peace in the Middle East](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/world/middleeast/trump-peace-plan-explained.html).

Trump himself seems largely to have forgotten it, too; it merited only a passing mention in his curiously dead-eyed State of the Union address, another piece of political wreckage occluding any view to the horizon of an actual historical narrative for these times we live in. And yet there it was: a monstrous bit of foreign policy that in another era might rank as major news.

Peace in the Middle East, in the American context, has always meant something like: a negotiated Palestinian capitulation, in which they agree to pretend to have a whittled-away pseudo-state in a portion of the territories seized by Israel in 1967, and the Israelis pretend to give them one. It has certainly never meant actual “peace” in the actual “Middle East,” which would require the U.S. to forswear its own regional ambitions and habit of invading and smashing up countries in what journalists and foreign policy wonks, when they are trying and failing to sound worldly, call “the region.” It is based, too, on the old notion that the principal driver of so-called instability in that selfsame region is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In this conception, the non-resolution of the question of Palestinian national aspiration is the main source of conflict in the Arab — and by extension (or interchangeably, depending on how crass the cable talking head) the greater Muslim — world.

>  The plan, insofar as it exists in actuality, is a hundred pages of gibberish.

But that conflict has for two decades at least now, ever since the U.S. began its latest cycle of incoherent imperial bloodletting from Afghanistan to West Africa been little more than a sorry sideshow within a much larger conflict. I don’t say so to diminish the vitality and necessity of the ongoing dream of Palestinian liberation, but rather to note a tragic symptom of the post-9/11 alignment of military and political interests. The repressive Gulf monarchies have largely made their peace with an increasingly repressive and right-wing Israel, whom they view as a necessary strategic partner, and the spiraling internal conflicts set off by U.S. and Western invasions of Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya — including the insoluble proxy-war muddle in Syria — have simply eclipsed the question of political settlement, just or otherwise, in historic Palestine.

And so the president’s Israel-Palestine peace plan, purportedly authored by his callow son-in-law Jared Kushner, arrived with neither pomp or circumstance, just a dull press conference in which the also-legally embattled Israeli president, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Trump slapped each other on the back in front of a hooting crowd of partisan Israeli journalists. The plan, insofar as it exists in actuality, is a hundred pages of gibberish, the sort of thing that a bunch of Georgetown legacy students would dash off as a group project two days before it was due. No Palestinians were consulted, and everyone knew from the outset that they would never consent; indeed, that their consent was beside the point.

The plan’s only newsworthy piece was its map, which laid bare what opponents of the colonial project of political Zionism have long predicted: a ratification of ongoing Israeli land seizures through “settlement” activity; a hacked-up and non-contiguous Palestine with no control of its own borders. The common metaphor has been Apartheid South Africa, and in the leftist press you will hear frequent references to “Bantustans,” the fictitiously autonomous black territories under the actual control of the white minority government and its military.

As is often the case, even on the left, this is a bit of parochial blindness to the often American inspiration for global iniquities. In fact, the closer analogue to Israeli aspirations, and to the aspirations of its American interlocutors, is America itself, specifically America’s long campaign against its own native inhabitants, its half-hearted “recognition” of indigenous “nations,” its creation of unsustainable land reservations, its paternalistic grants of economic goodies like casinos and tax breaks on cigarettes within these neither autonomous nor free territories. You can see this in the plan’s language of economic development, of opportunity zones and “high-tech manufacturing.” You can see it in the plan’s most hilarious and childish proposal, an Elon Musk fantasy of a 30-kilometer road tunnel running beneath the Negev Desert to connect Gaza to the carved-up carcass of the West Bank.

And this, in turn, reflects the degenerate reality of Israel’s own aspirations here, which is neither to contain nor to repress the Palestinians, but to see them dwindle and disappear. Even as a boy in liberal circles of Reform Judaism, I can remember the complaint: that the problem, after the Israeli war of Independence, was that none of the Arab States would “take them” — a wish for peace that was at heart a cruel desire for an impossible out-migration, a Palestinian Trail of Tears that we could later pretend was somehow voluntary.

> No Palestinians were consulted, and everyone knew from the outset that they would never consent; indeed, that their consent was beside the point.

America’s legacy Jewish institutions reacted to the plan along entirely predictable lines. The small-but-vocal politically conservative minority hailing the plan and making common cause with the anti-Semites of the evangelical Christian right, who see Israel as the battlefield in their bloody fantasy of global apocalypse. Mainstream institutions took their usual hem-and-haw, wait-and-see attitude, mouthing the same platitudes about an equitable solution that they have mouthed for the last 50 years while quietly acceding to the same old exculpatory fantasy that it is Palestinian intransigence rather than Israeli fascism which is the roadblock to a just political settlement. Where does this leave American Jews and American Judaism, the vital pole of diasporic Judaism? I’m not sure.

There are admirable attempts among the anti-Zionist Jewish left to craft a Jewish identity that is not wedded to the state of Israel, but our religious denominations — with the exception of a few tiny, radical sects of the ultra, ultra-orthodox — have not come along, not even within the Reform movement, which is and was America’s and Judaism’s great mutual gift and creation. We remain idolaters in our temples and our synagogues, stuck in a form of material worship of a piece of land that isn’t ours. Zion is here, if we allow it.
