The West Highland Way Route Map | Route Sections

# The Route

**The West Highland Way stretches 96 miles (154 Km) from Milngavie to Fort William, taking in a huge variety of scenery along the way, from countryside parks to loch-shores and open moorlands to steep mountains.**

Normally the route is completed from south to north, the thinking behind this being the southern stages are easier and will prepare you for the more demanding northern stages.

Due to the variety of distances involved, these sections should not necessarily be considered as a days activity. Planning of stage lengths should be based upon ability and fitness and the opportunities available to explore places of interest along the route. See our [itineraries](https://www.westhighlandway.org/the-route/suggested-itineraries/) section for ideas on how to split up the route.
