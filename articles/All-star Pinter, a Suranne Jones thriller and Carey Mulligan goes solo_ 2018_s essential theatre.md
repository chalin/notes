## **The Birthday Party**

[Toby Jones](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/toby-jones), [Zoë Wanamaker](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/zoe-wanamaker) and [Stephen Mangan](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/stephen-mangan) star in a [revival of a Pinter play](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/12/toby-jones-stephen-mangan-zoe-wanamaker-in-new-production-the-birthday-party) reviled at its premiere in 1958 and now accepted as a modern classic. [Ian Rickson](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/jun/14/ian-rickson-betrayal), who has already staged Betrayal and Old Times, directs a work that is like a mix of Agatha Christie and Kafka in that tantalising mystery is interwoven with political defiance.

• 9 January-14 April,[Harold Pinter theatre](http://www.thebirthdayparty.london/), London. Box office: 0844-871 7622.

## **John**

[Annie Baker](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/01/pulitzer-popcorn-playwright-annie-baker-critics-pause-thought)’s The Flick, set in a rundown movie house, was a masterpiece of hyperrealism. [Her latest play](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/12/john-review-play-annie-baker-signature-theatre-new-york), showing a Brooklyn couple checking into a spookily sinister Gettysburg B&B, is more a study in magical realism. Acclaimed at its American premiere in 2015, the play is directed at the National by James Macdonald and stars Anneika Rose and Tom Mothersdale.

• 17 January-3 March, Dorfman, [National Theatre](https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/john), London. Box office: 020-7452 3000.

## **Julius Caesar**

[![David Calder, Michelle Fairley, David Morrissey and Ben Whishaw in Nicholas Hytner’s production of Julius Caesar.](../_resources/e00d6e09e50cbf1ee75af5a00604f47c.jpg)](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/01/2018-essential-theatre-pinter-suranne-jones-carey-mulligan#img-2)

[Nicholas Hytner](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/nicholas-hytner)’s second show at his [brand spanking new theatre](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/apr/19/london-bridge-theatre-playwrights-nicholas-hytner-nick-starr) by Tower Bridge is Shakespeare’s ever topical play about how to address overweening political power. [Ben Whishaw](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ben-whishaw) is Brutus, [David Morrissey](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/david-morrissey) is Mark Antony and Michelle Fairley is Cassius in a production that reconfigures the theatre.

• 20 January-15 April, [The Bridge](https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/julius-caesar), London. Box office: 0843-208 1846.

## **The Culture – A Farce in Two Acts**

No season is complete without a new [James Graham](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/james-graham) play. After a bumper 2017 that brought us Ink, Labour of Love and Quiz, the phenomenal Graham, a local graduate, takes as his subject Hull’s year as [UK city of culture](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/uk-city-of-culture). Having been granted unparalleled behind-the-scenes access over the past 12 months, Graham should have a riveting story to tell in a production directed by Mark Babych.

• 26 January-17 February, [Hull Truck](https://www.hulltruck.co.uk/whats-on/drama-comedy/the-culture/). Box office: 01482 323638.

## The Captive Queen

John Dryden’s Restoration drama Aureng-zebe (1675) is here transposed to the late 20th century and the last days of the great Yorkshire woollen mills. It remains, however, a study of power and love and, in a co-production between [Shakespeare’s Globe](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/shakespeares-globe) and [Northern Broadsides](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/northern-broadsides), the retiring [Barrie Rutter](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jul/20/barrie-rutter-resigns-from-northern-broadsides-25-years) both directs and heads a predominantly British Asian cast.

• 2 February-4 March, [Sam Wanamaker Playhouse](http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/theatre/whats-on/sam-wanamaker-playhouse/the-captive-queen-2018), London. Box office: 020-7401 9919.

## The Shadow Factory

Samuel Hodges is expanding operations at the Nuffield, Southampton, to embrace a brand-new, multi-purpose, city-centre theatre. An ambitious opening season includes plays by Schiller, Aristophanes and Tennessee Williams and kicks off with a premiere from the prolific [Howard Brenton](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/howardbrenton) that looks back to autumn 1940 when 2,300 bombs were dropped by the Luftwaffe on Southampton itself. But the play, we are assured, is a story of courage and survival.

• 7 February-3 March, [NST City](https://www.nstheatres.co.uk/whats-on/the-shadow-factory), Southampton. Box office: 023-8067 1771.

## Girls and Boys

[Carey Mulligan](https://www.theguardian.com/film/carey-mulligan), whose impressive stage credits feature The Seagull and Skylight and whose movies include Suffragette and Mudbound, stars in Dennis Kelly’s disturbing one-woman play. It starts with a woman meeting her future husband in an EasyJet airport queue and tracks the gradual unravelling of their relationship. Lyndsey Turner directs and Es Devlin designs.

• 8 February-10 March, [Royal Court](https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/girls-and-boys/), London. Box office: 020-7565 5000.

## The York Realist

[Peter Gill](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/peter-gill)’s beautiful play about sex, class and cultural identity, which won countless awards in 2001, gets a long-overdue revival. At its heart is the story of a brief affair between a northern farmhand and a London theatre director working on a 1960s production of the York Mystery Plays. Robert Hastie, who had a great success at the Donmar with My Night With Reg, directs a strong cast headed by Ben Batt, Jonathan Bailey and Lesley Nicol.

• 8 February-24 March at [Donmar Warehouse](https://www.donmarwarehouse.com/production/6395/the-york-realist/), London. Box office: 020-3282 3808; 27 March-7 April, [Sheffield Crucible](https://www.sheffieldtheatres.co.uk/whats-on/the-york-realist). Box office: 0114-249 6000.

## Wonderland

[![Wonderland, Nottingham Playhouse](../_resources/701c4f457a8f23a359f573c9ca97a6c8.jpg)](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/01/2018-essential-theatre-pinter-suranne-jones-carey-mulligan#img-4)

  Re-creating the tensions of the 1984 miners’ strike in Wonderland, at Nottingham Playhouse

Adam Penford, in his first production as Nottingham’s artistic director, offers the regional premiere of a play with enormous local resonance. Beth Steel’s impressive piece, first seen at Hampstead theatre in 2014, vividly re-creates the tensions of the 1984 miners’ strike and shows an intransigent government coming into collision with a proudly defiant coal-based community.

• 9-24 February, [Nottingham Playhouse](https://www.nottinghamplayhouse.co.uk/whats-on/drama/wonderland/). Box office: 0115-941 9419.

## Frozen

[![Suranne Jones leads a starry cast.](../_resources/5570be5c675d6f1e17423c42cd81d534.jpg)](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/01/2018-essential-theatre-pinter-suranne-jones-carey-mulligan#img-5)

Suranne Jones, Jason Watkins and Nina Sosanya form the starry cast in this revival of [Bryony Lavery](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/bryonylavery)’s tense 1998 play, first seen at Birmingham Rep, about the disappearance of a 10-year-old child. Starting with monologues, the play charts the separate viewpoints of the child’s mother, a serial killer and a New York psychiatrist before going to on embrace wider themes of remorse and redemption. Jonathan Munby directs.

• 9 February-5 May, [Theatre Royal Haymarket](http://www.trh.co.uk/whatson/frozen/), London. Box office: 020-7930 8800.

## The Belle’s Stratagem

This neglected gem from [Hannah Cowley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Cowley), first seen in 1780, is a riposte to Farquhar’s The Beaux’ Stratagem and a tribute to female ingenuity. Transposing the action from London to Edinburgh’s New Town, Tony Cownie’s adaptation shows the heroine, Letitia (once played by Ellen Terry), using her wits to reclaim the attention of Doricourt who, having travelled throughout Europe, now loftily scorns what he terms “dull Scottish lassies”.

• 15 February-10 March, [Royal Lyceum](https://lyceum.org.uk/whats-on/production/the-belles-stratagem), Edinburgh. Box office: 0131-248 4848.

## Macbeth

You have to admire the courage of [Rufus Norris](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/rufus-norris). With little experience of Shakespeare (though he did once direct a production of The Tempest), he tackles this notoriously tricky tragedy on the National’s most exposed stage. Fortunately he has [Rory Kinnear](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/rory-kinnear), once a tremendous Hamlet, and [Anne-Marie Duff](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/anne-marie-duff), equally at home in the classics and new plays, as, arguably, Shakespeare’s only truly happy married couple.

• From 26 February, [Olivier](https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/macbeth) theatre, London. Box office: 020-7452 3000.

## The Cherry Orchard

[![Kirsty Bushell and Jude Owusu will star in The Cherry Orchard, at the Bristol Old Vic.](../_resources/c90fb9c79163c518458bcb4d964c0c49.jpg)](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/01/2018-essential-theatre-pinter-suranne-jones-carey-mulligan#img-6)

  For Russophiles … Kirsty Bushell and Jude Owusu will star in The Cherry Orchard, at the Bristol Old Vic. Photograph: Seamus Ryan

Astonishingly, given his Russophile tendencies when director of the RSC, this will be Michael Boyd’s firstever Chekhov production. It is part of Bristol Old Vic’s ambitious Year of Change season and will see designer Tom Piper reconfiguring the 250-year-old theatre’s auditorium. Kirsty Bushell, who never fails to impress, and Jude Owusu head the cast of Rory Mullarkey’s adaptation that will also play at Manchester’s Royal Exchange.

• 1 March-7 April, [Bristol Old Vic](http://www.bristololdvic.org.uk/the-cherry-orchard.html). Box office: 0117-987 7877.

## Frankenstein

In the 200 years since its publication, Mary Shelley’s novel has inspired countless theatrical adaptations: most recently, [Danny Boyle’s sensational National Theatre production](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/feb/24/review-frankenstein-olivier-theatre-boyle) and Mel Brooks’s hilarious musical, [Young Frankenstein](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/11/young-frankenstein-review-mel-brooks-horror-spoof-musical). Now [April de Angelis](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/angelis) comes up with a new version that, one hopes, will capture something of the radical Shelley’s rage against social injustice and the hero’s divine presumption. Matthew Xia, who has staged Wish List and Into The Woods, directs and Shane Zaza stars as the vainglorious Victor.

• 9 March-7 April, [Royal Exchange](https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/whats-on-and-tickets/frankenstein), Manchester. Box office: 0161-833 9833.

## The Last Ship

[![Sting, whose musical The Last Ship is sailing to Newcastle.](../_resources/d082444cf13425d2f7ec0eef5516fdf8.jpg)](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/01/2018-essential-theatre-pinter-suranne-jones-carey-mulligan#img-7)

  Sting, whose musical The Last Ship is sailing to Newcastle. Photograph: Mark Savage

Sting’s musical, based on his own memories of growing up in Wallsend, lasted a bare three months [on Broadway in 2015](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/27/the-last-ship-review-sting-neil-simon-theatre). Now it has been extensively reworked and is launched, appropriately enough, in Newcastle before undertaking a national tour. It tells the story of a sailor who returns home to find the shipbuilding community he once knew in chaos and a local foreman, played by Jimmy Nail, fighting to save it. With Sting’s score and a brand-new production by Lorne Campbell, New York’s loss should be Tyneside’s gain.

• 12 March-7 April, [Northern Stage](https://www.northernstage.co.uk/Event/the-last-ship), Newcastle. Box office: 0191-230 5151.

## Strictly Ballroom: The Musical

Drew McOnie directed and choreographed this version of Baz Luhrmann’s 1992 hit movie at West Yorkshire Playhouse in 2016. Now it’s been revamped and recast, but it remains the same deliciously corny story about a talented young dancer who defies the rules and finds a new partner in an overlooked cleaner. Jonny Labey as the fleet-footed hero, Zizi Strallen as the dance-hall Cinderella and singer Will Young head the cast and, if it’s anything like [the Leeds production](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/dec/08/strictly-ballroom-the-musical-review-baz-luhrmann-drew-mconie), it should dance up a storm.

• From 16 March, [Piccadilly theatre](https://www.piccadillytheatre.org/strictly-ballroom-the-musical/), London. Box office: 0844 871 7630.

## The Fantastic Follies of Mrs Rich

[![The Fantastic Follies of Mrs Rich at The Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon.](../_resources/395395421bf48fc3de16f3426b57eaeb.jpg)](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/01/2018-essential-theatre-pinter-suranne-jones-carey-mulligan#img-8)

  The Fantastic Follies of Mrs Rich at the Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon.

[Mary Pix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Pix) (1666-1709) is hardly a name to conjure with. She is, however, one of that generation of Restoration female wits gradually being rediscovered by our theatres; this play, written in 1700 and originally titled The Beau Defeated, gets a rare outing from the RSC. It’s the story of a wealthy widow who’s after a title, boasts a large number of roles for women and is directed by Jo Davies who had a previous success at Stratford with The Roaring Girl.

• 23 March-14 June, [The Swan](https://www.rsc.org.uk/the-fantastic-follies-of-mrs-rich/), Stratford-upon-Avon. Box office: 01789 403493.

## Pericles

Dismissed by Dr Johnson as “a mouldy tale”, this late Shakespeare, with help from an unnamed collaborator, has enjoyed a huge revival of fortune in recent years. Clearly something in this epic story of a seagoing hero’s misfortunes, of his reunion with a lost daughter and of his dead wife’s rebirth chimes with our hunger for resurrection myths. Cheek by Jowl’s [Declan Donnellan](http://www.cheekbyjowl.com/declan_donnellan.php) and Nick Ormerod, having traversed the globe themselves, for the first time offer us Shakespeare with a French company.

• 6-21 April, [Silk Street theatre](https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2018/event/cheek-by-jowl-pericles-pericles-prince-de-tyr), Barbican, London. Box office: 0845-120 7511.

## The Assassination of Katie Hopkins

This provocatively titled musical examines the fictional death of the rightwing columnist who certainly gets everyone’s juices flowing. Chris Bush has written the script, Matt Winkworth the music and James Grieve, artistic boss of Paines Plough, directs. The aim, we are assured, is to offer a serious examination of social media, mob mentality and the limits of free speech. But will the show simply fuel, as if it needed it, Hopkins’ outsized ego?

• From 20 April, [Theatre](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre) Clwyd, Mold. Box office: 01352 701521.

## Eddie and the Slumber Sisters

The ever-enterprising [National Theatre](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/national-theatre) of Scotland comes up with a family touring show exploring the vexed question of how children cope with the loss of grandparents. Eddie herself is a sensitive child, quiet and reserved by day but haunted at night by memories of her nan who was bright, funny, exuberant and her best pal. It’s exactly the kind of topic our theatre generally skirts, but Anita Vettesse as writer and Gill Robertson as director tackle it head on.

• From 28 April, Brunton theatre, Musselburgh. Box office: 0131-665 2240. Then on tour throughout Scotland.
