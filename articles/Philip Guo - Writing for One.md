Writing for One December 2014 (perspective of an assistant professor ) Summary If you have trouble writing, imagine yourself writing to one specific person. Many people have trouble writing. That doesn't surprise me. However, what does surprise me is how these same people often have no trouble writing emails to me. Their emails are clear, coherent, and to the point. Yet when they write for a broader audience, their writing falls short. Here's my pet theory of what's going on: When someone is writing an email to me, they know exactly who the reader is (me!), what I know, and (more importantly) what I don't know. Also, they know what the purpose of their email is, or else they wouldn't be sending it in the first place.
