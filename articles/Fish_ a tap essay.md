# Fish: a tap essay

This is a kind of manifesto about the difference between *liking* something on the internet and *loving* something on the internet.

It’s also an experiment in a new format: a “tap essay,” presenting its argument tap by tap, making its case with typography, color, and a few surprises.

I created it in 2012, then forgot about it, and ultimately lost the source code. Now, it’s available again: recoded, remastered, expanded.

Fish was an object of some curiosity after its release in 2012.
