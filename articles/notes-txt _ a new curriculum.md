is our educational curriculum the best it could be?

after completing school, I realized how many inaccuracies were taught in our science & history classes, and how many important skills we missed

for example, why don't we spend more time **learning about learning**?

- there are mental techniques, such as the **[memory palace](https://wetwarewiki.com/Memory)**, which enhance your ability to store and remember knowledge by 10x (not an exaggeration!). how did we miss that in school?

plus other omissions:

- basic truths about the universe — like **evolution**, **how the mind works**, and fundamental physics concepts like **relativity** — were given brief coverage if any.
- **absolute pitch**, the rare ability to identify a musical note like F# just by hearing it, can be a massive benefit to a musician. you can learn the skill in a matter of weeks, but it can only be acquired before the age of 7. **only 0.01% of people end up learning it in time!**

below are some general ideas for a different school curriculum, focused on bootstrapping students for better success in learning & life:

## [human school — curriculum v0.1](https://notes-txt.com/curriculum.html#human-school--curriculum-v01)

### Learning skills

- **Memory techniques** -- memory palace, elaborative encoding, note-taking, mind mapping, Anki / spaced repetition, mnemonics like PEMDAS, SOHCAHTOA.
- How the brain works.
- **How to read a book.** How to understand an argument.
- **Sleep's role in learning.** How to get better sleep. Schools should start late enough for all students to get enough sleep.
- How to use the Internet to learn: Google, Wikipedia

### Individual skills

- Physical health: good eating and exercise habits
- Finding your interests and strengths
- **Meditation**
- **Organization**: Tidying up. Keeping a journal, planner, or similar system.
- Wide exposure to interest areas like music, visual art, dancing, athletics, etc.

### Social skills

- **How to listen:** in-person, non-verbal communication, and online.
- How to be a friendly, well-liked person.
- **Writing of all forms including texts, tweets, emails, and articles.** We over-emphasize essaywriting and reading old literature.
- **Language as a holistic displine**: English, etymology & Greek/Latin roots, foreign languages like Chinese, alternate forms of communication like Sign Language and Emoji.
- Public speaking, presentations.
- Group problem solving. Group competitions.

### Our World

- **Life & evolution**: how we think life emerged. what is life, DNA. how evolution explains many questions, like why the grass is green. how & why cells divide and form into shapes and functions.
- **Human beings**: history of humanity, what it means to be human, human anatomy & biology, human literature, religions, cultures, and stories
- **The Universe**: how all matter is made inside stars, what is a galaxy, the big bang, what is matter made of, spacetime, relativity. how microwaves, visible light, Wi-Fi, and radio waves are all the same thing.
- **Computers**: how they work, useful programs, how to use them, how to program them
- **Society**: how towns, cities, nations are organized. Capitalism: taxes, what is a stock, what is a market, what is a company, how consumer demand drives what is sold.

* * *

this list isn't organized around the traditional areas of study: **math, science, social studies, english, art**, etc.

instead, it focuses about learning about **how to improve ourselves**, **our ability to communicate**, and **our understanding of the world**. the traditional areas of study will be in service to these goals, and would be given greater meaning
