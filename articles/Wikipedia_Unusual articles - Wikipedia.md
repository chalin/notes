Still, all such lists risk being deleted for lack of a neutral definition of what counts as "unusual". |

A cow with antlers atop a pole. Wikipedia contains other images and articles that are [similarly shocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibilance) or [udderly amoosing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun).

There are over five million articles in the English Wikipedia. These are the ones that Wikipedians have identified as being a bit unusual. These articles are verifiable, valuable contributions to the encyclopedia, but are a bit odd, whimsical, or something you would not expect to find in *[Encyclopædia Britannica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica)*. We should take special care to meet the highest standards of an encyclopedia with these articles lest they make Wikipedia appear *[idiosyncratic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/idiosyncratic)*. If you wish to add articles to this list, the article in question should preferably meet one or more of these criteria:

- The article is something a reasonable person would not expect to find in a standard encyclopedia.
- The subject is a highly unusual combination of concepts, such as [cosmic latte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte), [death from laughter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_from_laughter), etc.
- The subject is a clear anomaly—something that defies common sense, common expectations or common knowledge, such as [Bir Tawil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bir_Tawil), [Märket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A4rket), [Phineas Gage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage), [List of snow events in Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_snow_events_in_Florida), etc.
- The subject is well-documented for unexpected notoriety or an unplanned [cult following](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following) at extreme levels, such as [Ampelmännchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampelm%C3%A4nnchen) or [All your base are belong to us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us).
- The subject is a notorious [hoax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax), such as [Sokal affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair) or [Mary Toft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Toft).
- The subject would normally be found amusing, though serious.
- The article is a list or collection of articles or subjects meeting the criteria above.

This definition is not precise; some articles may still be considered unusual even if they do not fit these guidelines.

To keep the list of interest to readers, each entry on this list should be an article on its own (not merely a section in a less unusual article) and of decent quality, in large meeting [Wikipedia's manual of style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_style). For unusual contributions that are of greater levity, see [Wikipedia:Silly Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Silly_Things). *A star ([![Featured article](../_resources/df9529180c214c0da4df2cfc0672c824.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Featured_article_star.svg)) indicates a [featured article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles). A plus (![16px-Featured_article_star.svg.png](../_resources/c9301caeddda509c68ee3b33563beac2.png)) indicates a [good article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_articles).*
