## [(L)](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS#in-person-training)In-person Training

The content for these books derives heavily from a series of training materials I teach professionally (in both public and private-corporate workshop format): "Deep JavaScript Foundations", "Rethinking Async", and "ES6: The Right Parts" workshops.

If you like this content and would like to contact me regarding conducting training on these, or other various JS/HTML5/node.js topics, please reach out to me through email: getify @ gmail

## [(L)](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS#online-video-training)Online Video Training

I also have some JS training material available in on-demand video format. I teach courses through [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/), like my [Deep JavaScript Foundations](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-foundations/) workshop. You can find [all my courses here](https://frontendmasters.com/kyle-simpson/).

Some of those courses are also distributed on other platforms, like Pluralsight, Lynda.com, and O'Reilly Safari Online.
