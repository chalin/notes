Jake Day Williams  | Numberphile videos need a NSFW tag. It's hard to get any work done after watching them.

zeidrichthorene  | An interesting thing about this: In Base 2, 82000 is 10100000001010000. In base 2, 10100000001010000 is 1 + 11 + 1111 + 111111 + 11111111111111 + 1111111111111111

In Base 3, 82000 is 11011111001 In Base 3, 11011111001 is 22 + 222 + 2222 + 22222 + 222222 + 2222222 + 222222222 + 2222222222 (corrected)

In Base 5, 82000 is 10111000  In Base 5, 10111000 is 4 + 444 + 4444 + 44444 + 4444444

Just food for thought.
It doesn't really work in base 4, it is 3 + 33 +333 + 3333333 + 33333333 (+ 1)
But it's interesting that these are similar for the prime bases.

Erik  | I am currently writing a C# program that will hopefully solve this mystery (of what comes after 82,000). I will return.
