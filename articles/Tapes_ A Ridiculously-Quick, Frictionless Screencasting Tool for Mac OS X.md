# Tapes: A Ridiculously-Quick, Frictionless Screencasting Tool for Mac OS X.

![AppIcon.175x175-75](../_resources/532ff4a7db653139f7c07414f9246ac6.png)A while ago I wrote a [post covering all the screencasting tools](https://andrewdouch.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/the-best-screencasting-software-for-teachers/) I could think of from expensive-and-complex at one end of the continuum to free-and-simple at the other. Since writing that post, I have discovered another screencasting tool that I am quite enamoured of.

[Tapes](https://v.usetapes.com/r/9SPtpdTLaKOkMSCukCkh) is the simplest and fastest way to make a screencast I’ve ever seen. It’s quick. I mean really, really, quick to use.

Click on the Tapes menu bar item, choose “Record New Tape” and bang! you are recording. When you choose “Stop and Upload”, it instantly tells you that a link has already been placed on your clipboard. You can immediately paste that into an email or discussion thread, even as the video is still being uploaded in the background! It’s that easy and quick. Watch this little 1 minute demonstration to see what I mean. It’s really quite something.

It’s not the tool I’d use to make a full-featured screencast. But for a quick explanation, it just can’t be beat.

[Tapes](https://v.usetapes.com/r/9SPtpdTLaKOkMSCukCkh) has a one-time purchase price of $12:99, which also gives you 60 minutes of recording each month (ongoing) but if you buy it from [this promo code](https://v.usetapes.com/r/9SPtpdTLaKOkMSCukCkh), you’ll get an extra 15 minutes per month.

If you are looking for a free alternative, [QuickCast](http://quickcast.io/) is similar but not so amazing.  For example, unlike Tapes, when you click to record, it gives you a 5 second count-in, whereas Tapes just starts recording.  Also with QuickCast, once you finish recording, you have to wait until the video has finished *uploading* before a share link becomes available. Furthermore, once your video has finished uploading in QuickCast you have to pull down the QuickCast menu and click on the video, to copy a share link, whereas Tapes does all that for you.

Those shortcomings in QuickCast might seem inconsequential, but they mean you’ll find yourself wasting minutes every time you make a screencast, whereas in Tapes – as soon as you’re finished recording, you can paste the link somewhere, and forget about it, moving on to the next task. That increase in efficiency is noticeable – and since efficiency is the core reason for wanting to use either of these apps in the first place, Tapes is the better choice.
