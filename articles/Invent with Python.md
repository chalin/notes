# Learn to Program. For Free.

Learning to program makes you a smarter and more capable human being.

Rocket science uses programming, but programming isn't rocket science. Whether you're a student preparing for a software career, an office worker with a folder full of spreadsheet files, or a hobbyist who wants to make video games, the Python programming language is an excellent start in the world of programming.

I'm Al Sweigart, and I write books to teach beginners to code. I put them online for free, because programming is too valuable and needs to be accessible to all. (You can also buy print and ebooks versions.)

Get started. It's a great journey.

## The second edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is available October 29th!

> "Introductions to Python are easy to find. But at the end of the day most Python tutorials for beginners end up being the same lessons repackaged, often leaving the new programmer with gaping holes in how their newly acquire skills can be applied practically. This is not one of those books. Where this book stands out is the second part where you actually build useful tools you might need to use every day. The author does a fantastic job of bridging the concepts and skills you learned earlier to real world applications."

> "I am a college professor who occasionally teaches courses for liberal arts students. [...] I offered a game programming course in the Python programming language using Sweigart's book. The students loved this book. It starts at the very beginning and leads them, game by fascinating game, to become highly capable programmers."
