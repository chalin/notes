# Benefits of a daily diary and topic journals

2019-01-28

You know those people whose lives are transformed by meditation or yoga or something like that?

For me, it’s writing in my diary and journals. It’s made all the difference in the world for my learning, reflecting, and peace of mind.

After 20+ years of doing this, here’s what I do and recommend:

### A daily diary

If digital, use only plain text. It’s a standard format not owned by any company. It will be readable in 50 years on devices we haven’t even imagined yet. Don’t use formats that can only be read by one program, because that program won’t be around in 50 years. Don’t use the cloud, unless you’re also going to download it weekly and back it up in plain text outside that cloud. (Companies shut down. Clouds disappear. Think long-term.)

**Every day at some point, just open up this diary, write today’s date, then start writing.**Write what you did today, and how you are feeling, even if it seems boring.

It works best as a nightly routine. Just take a few minutes and write at least a few sentences. If you have time, write down everything on your mind. Clear it all out. But if you miss a night, make time the next morning to write about the previous day.

This is important because years from now you might be looking back, wondering if you were as happy or as sad as you remember during this time. So don’t only write the drama or dilemmas. Include the daily facts of life.

We so often make big decisions in life based on predictions of how we think we’ll feel in the future, or what we’ll want. Your past self is your best indicator of how you actually felt in similar situations. So it helps to have an accurate picture of your past.

You can’t trust distant memories, but you can trust your daily diary. It’s the best indicator to your future self (and maybe descendants) of what was really going on in your life at this time.

If you’re feeling you don’t have the time or it’s not interesting enough, remember:**You’re doing this for your future self.**Future you will want to look back at this time in your life, and find out what you were actually doing, day-to-day, and how you really felt back then. It will help you make better decisions.

Just put aside a few minutes to write what you did and how you felt today.

### “Thoughts On” journals

There are certain subjects in your life you think about a lot. People, places, hobbies, health, plans, finances.

**For each subject that you might have ongoing thoughts about, start a separate “Thoughts On” journal.**Whenever you have some thoughts on this subject, open up that file, write today’s date, then start writing.

To give you an example, here are my “Thoughts On” journals as of today:

- Accounting
- Addiction
- Airports
- Alcohol
- Ambition

I find it so useful to keep my thoughts on each subject together, because I can see my past thoughts and current thoughts in one place. I can see how my thoughts on this subject have evolved or keep repeating. Sometimes I think I have a new thought on a subject, so I open up the file and write it down, then afterwards I see I had that same thought a year ago and had forgotten about it.**If you care about your thoughts, keep them.**

They can be tiny. Like you see I have one on airports. I don’t have many thoughts on airports. I don’t fly that much. But I found that once or twice a year, when waiting at the gate, I had thoughts on the subject, so I’d open that file and start writing.

I’ve considered making one for every musician, album, book, or film that’s had an impact on me, that I’d like to think more about. Why not? I admire the way that a good critic puts in hours of reflection on each piece, thinking deeper about something they’ve just taken in.

I especially like my “Regrets” journal. Whenever I do something I regret, I write it down there, noting why I regret it, what I wish I would have done instead, and how I hope to prevent this in the future.

### Ask yourself questions, then question your answers.

Whether in your daily diary, or the “Thoughts On” journals, I find the single most useful thing has been using it as a place to ask myself questions, and answer them.

If I’m planning on doing something, I ask myself what I hope to get out of it, why, and whether there are other ways to get what I want.

When I’m feeling conflicted, especially, I’ll ask myself a bunch of questions to work through my feelings, looking for the source of the conflict, then ask myself more questions around the clash in values, and work through other alternate ways I’d like things to be.

**I answer with my initial thought first, but then question it afterwards with skepticism, and consider different perspectives.**I hear this is similar to [cognitive behavioral therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) — and I’ve been meaning to learn more about that. But whatever you call it, I think it’s been the single most important thing to my intellectual and emotional development.

Almost all the thoughts I have on any subject are the result of writing in my diary and journals, then questioning myself and working through alternate ways of thinking about it, and finally returning to the subject days or months later with a clear head and updated thoughts, seeing how they’ve changed or not over time.

I hope it helps you too.

The irony is...

I kept one while attending music school. And my one new thing to do this year was to keep a daily journal starting Jan 1. I've been pretty good about it until the last couple of days - I blame it on NAMM. Sensory overload and not enough time before passing out at night. However, I will be doing a full recap of the past 3 days later tonight.

The big thing for me was to find an app to do it with multiple devices. While I haven't found that app yet, I did start with my laptop to keep it.

2. Marsha Shandur (2019-01-28) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69534)

I hadn’t ever thought about your reason for keeping a daily diary — about it telling the truth of how you really felt, when you look back — and I absolutely love it. I don’t know that every single day is realistic, but I’m going to try harder to get some things down even when nothing particularly momentous is happening, especially for this reason.

Thanks!

Love this article, especially the idea of “Thoughts on...” I’ve been using a little free service called AhhLife for the last four years and can highly recommend it.

[http://ahhlife.com](http://ahhlife.com/)

It works by emailing you every night. You reply to it with your journal entry for the day. Or you can reply every morning. It’s super lightweight and configurable. And since it works over email you automatically have a backup of your data over time. I have never found anything easier for getting into the habit of daily journaling.

Cheers,
Obie

Nice to hear from you. It’s been a long time.

Yes. This is a good reminder. At least 4-5 dozen people have asked me to write my book. Everytime I tell a story..... it’s hard to remember past experiences unless some reminder pops up in a conversation. My late husband was a brilliant novelist, columnist, journalist. My late brother in law was a super famous novelist, screenwriter. Etc. Maybe I was surrounded by too much success in that area so I have been unable to fulfill my own destiny. I was always intending to be a writer.

Interesting too as I just saw the film THE WIFE ....with Glenn Close. I won’t ruin it for you in case you haven’t seen it. You should.

Thanks for the prompt.

Hi Derek

Good to hear from you. I started back into practice as a marriage family therapist and I use cognitive therapy regularly and now they have dialectical behavior therapy what is cognitive therapy + mindfulness. IRA progoff wrote a book on journal writing and there's lots of interesting psychology books about that such as embracing ourselves by winkleman and Stone where you dialogue with a different side of yourself like the inner critic or the inner child or the feminine side or the angry side or the scared side etc.

I am pleased to say that Christina has been writing new songs and would like to make a new CD this year. I've been driving Uber and Lyft part-time and I said a prayer what's next Lord and I meant Alexandre de Lyon a singer who opened up for Bruno Mars and has the agent Chris Knight who works with maroon 5 and then I met a guy who promotes for an r&b artist next day and then I met virtual reality LA and then I met a guy from RCA and then I met Steve Chen from YouTube and a bunch of other people ending up with a couple people from my neighborhood when is Nick Gallant with Disney and Drew oropeza who wrote a couple songs that ended up in the top 40 he was actually able to buy a house these days in our old neighborhood with the royalties. I'm hoping that we all have a great New year.

This is a great idea. I have kept journals forever. but the journals according to subject are important....that's a great idea.

BTW....NAMM is too noisy anyore....

What are your thoughts on electronic vs paper? Big fan of your stuff. Thanks.

I prefer digital because it takes no space, I have it with me almost everywhere always, and most of all: I can type one command to search it and get instant results. -- Derek

It's good advice. Since I'm constantly reflecting (against my will), for me that kind of introspection would be exhausting. However, I do journal my family life and have been for 20 years (so I have about 2000 pages of family journals!) These are not particularly deep, yet they do describe accurately things that happened, how I responded, etc. that memory would tend to alter.

11. Adam Ford (2019-01-28) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69543)
Great list.

I think like yoga and meditation it may take a little work at the beginning to develop the skill. Not sure how much I’ll have to write about some days.

I’ll need to improve my thinking to evolve my writing.

Great article, thank you.

Adam.

Very interesting, as usual. I've been keeping diaries for many years. Longhand in the typical college notebook. Anything and everything. Essays. Poems. Precis for a show. Synopsis for a show. Names.

Quites a stack of notebooks by now. keep calendars also. Take a listen to sample of my new 45 rpm (!). Teamed with German co that publishes

A Is For Apple and also manufactures 45s of Apple centric artists
It's a RAD lovesong. www.brutesforce.com/confections/products/

The main thing here is just keeping it going...the body, the will, the self-esteem...amidst the attempts to gain recognition in the undeniable

horror of this realm.

And this... my current attempt to communicate the Pledge of Allegiance to The Planet to the world. Want to bring his understanding to 2020 Tokyo Olympics...what could be more logical than the people from all over the world pledging allegiance to the planet...and here is the way to do that.

[http://planetwork.world](http://planetwork.world/)

Besides your own reach and influence you may have friends, associates, colleagues in the Olympics and can consider aiding in this consciousness raising project.

All The Best,

HaHa! Had to share this, I glanced at the topic in my email from you and I read it as Daily DAIRY and Journals. (With daily having ai also, my brain put it in both words). I certainly had a thought about that. "You're kidding, he thinks we should eat dairy daily, I haven't had dairy in over a year." I HAVE to read this one. I didn't catch it until the 2nd line of the blog... LOL.

Love this, what a magnificent way to learn the habits or our own minds, much of which is culturally created and seems to have an opinion on about everything as you've pointed out. I love these experiments and practices you share. Great advice on Plain Text Editors, got me to thinking about my cloud situation and maybe I better jump on that with important stuff... Thanks.

I’ve been keeping journals for years. Thoughts are amorphous. When I write my ideas down they manifest into material form. Lately, I’ve been trying to pay more attention to my hand motion as I write. It feels like a mindfulness practice. My wife thinks I’m nuts with so many journals strewn around the house. I also keep digital versions. I write everything down.

I find that there is a difference in output quality when I physically put pen to paper. It’s like holding a guitar while songwriting where your whole body becomes a vehicle for the muse.

I particularly like my “feelings” journals. Overtime I am able to observe feeling patterns and how certain kinds of thinking produce certain kinds of feelings. Putting those observations to paper has helped me see how many of my thoughts lead to emotions that don’t serve me well. You might say this is a form of EQ or emotional intelligence. As a result, I allow fewer thought/feeling disruptions to upset my happiness baseline thereby contributing to my overall life satisfaction. Big win.

  I’m in the middle of reading “Essentialism” by Greg McKeown where he devotes a few pages to journal writing. BTW your name came up in the book. Better there than a bathroom wall. Thanks always DS for your value add contributions.

I have been meaning to restart a daily journal like I used to keep in my teenage years and early twenties. It's one of those things I know it's good for me but keep putting off anyway. Your thoughts have encouraged me. Thank you.

I don't have a Thoughts On one, but I do have a general one and try to write daily. It really does help to iron things out in the mind, clear the clutter, and secondarily to hone the writing chops.

Hi Derek. I've been doing the journal thing for about 5 years now. It is amazing looking back and seeing what my mind was working on. Last year I expanded on this by doing a video log on my worst days. Its one thing to read how I was feeling but a real mind blower to actually see my face and hear my voice

25. David Levin (2019-01-28) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69557)
Hey Derek,

This is excellent. I recommend a similar habit in my Raise Your Inner Game material. I do mine in the morning, though, as part of my morning routine. Sit. Journal. Most every day. With, of course, some stretches where I don't. ☺ But rarely do I miss for more than a week or ten days. And I can really tell when I do.

Mine is what you would probably call a feeling journal. I think of it as my Inner Game journal. It's just a daily note on how things are going, internally. What's stressing me out. How the previous day went (doing the daily things that help, avoiding the bad habits).

Technically, I use Scrivener. Probably because I have it. ☺ But I like having a different page for each entry, but all of them still grouped together in the app.

Anyway, I was just talking with a reader about the daily journal two days ago. It is THE thing that makes the difference for me, over the long haul.

Two big things it does:

1) Keeps my inner game top of mind. The biggest cause of slipping off track is forgetting. Writing about it daily keeps that from happening.

2) Takes away the power of the negatives. If I notice that I'm feeling especially stressed, for example, or anxious or depressed, just noticing that takes away a huge amount of its power over me. I see it, and then I can plan what to do that day to deal with it. Impossible to overstate the benefits of that.

Finally, it smoothes out the ups and downs. Over time, writing daily about what's going on for you, you start see things over a longer arc, and realize life is not really as out of control as it can seem. ☺

Anyway, great post. And good to hear from you!

David

27. Draven Midnight (2019-01-28) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69559)
Cognitive behavioral therapy sounds interesting Derek.

Personally my journaling has been more utilitarian as of late.
Tracking progress, goal setting, weekly/daily planning, etc.

Rarely I’ll go back & review. Though it is pretty rewarding to see how an approach or thoughts on things have changed over time.

Writing is a great snapshot like that.

Lack of writing/journaling daily seems to put me on a slippery slope when it comes to getting the musts complete for the day.

Idk bout you but I like hitting the marks I set for myself in a given window. Drives a sense of accomplishment & fulfillment for the day/week/month/year, etc.

Would you agree?
Yep! -- Derek

The regret list is definetly a great idea, will start doing that too.

I've been writing my diary since primary school. I prefer the traditional way to record my thoughts on paper every day before bed (I do sketch and draw a lot). One of the most obvious benefits of keep a journal is helping me with my sleep. Once I transfer my thoughts from my head onto the paper, I have the clear vision of where my worries/problems are and then I can tell myself I'll be able to find the solution after a good sleep. I think the strategy here is once you see clearly rather than everything is so messy in your head, you'll be able to persuade yourself to have a rest.

37. Kathena Bryant (2019-01-28) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69569)
When you say, "Use plain text, or a standard format not owned by any company"

do you mean to save in a format that can be opened easily in whatever platform? What if I create in Pages, what would be a good format to save my journal in where I can keep it going and add to it daily and read it on PC & apple and whatever operating system may come along? It seems word processors are owned by companies, but I suppose the plain text is not. I'm sorry if my question seems tedious. I have been keeping a journal and backing it up offline, but I want to make sure about how to save them. Thanks!

Yes, not Pages. On Mac, use TextEdit. On Windows, use WordPad. Some day you might be using a different kind of computer that's not invented yet, and will deeply regret if everything is saved in the Mac-only “Pages” program. But if you save in plain text or “Rich Text” (.rtf) you'll be able to read it on any future computer (or watch or hologram or reading robot or whatever). -- Derek

38. Bill Alpert (2019-01-28) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69570)
Solid inspiration! Thanks!

What about just a single file, journal and "thoughts on" all together. Create a hashtag around said thoughts. For example:

2019/01/27 Caught up on music practice and house cleaning. All alone today and felt a bit lonely with the wife out of town.. #musicpractice: finding a full day or more of alone time creates a "cleaner" environment for problem solving

39. Mike (2019-01-28) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69571)

You've done it again with this insightful--and inciteful--post. I began years ago to keep journals. I think it was a Jim Rohn recommendation to do so that got me into it. I started with hard-bound archival record books, and have experimented with many other types and styles since. I currently write daily in a Moleskine. My kids tease me that my journals, all shelved, make me look like Kevin Spacey's character in "Seven." But the good news is that I have quite a record of my life and thought at this point. It's helped me to recognize patterns in my life that needed to change, and provides an awesome reminder of how far I have come in my life. But I do prefer the analog way, obviously. I like the idea of people knowing I've actually touched the pages, and you can tell by my penmanship what kind of mood I was in when I was writing. Thanks for reminding me of the importance of my practice. Peace.

The "thoughts" suggestion I love! Total brain overload just thinking about your list of thoughts and what my thoughts are on each... must admit I have kind of got a little bogged down at "kissing" got me thinking.....sorry thoughting? (insert laughing emoji here)

Thanks Derek.
42. Sanjay (2019-01-28) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69574)

I have been doing this for a few years now (on and off). The interesting thing is reviewing past journals. I have found some very repetitive patterns... there are things that I have been complaining about and working on changing (at least according to my journals) for a number of year now... and yet I am still writing and complaining about the same things.

43. John thomas Oaks (2019-01-28) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69575)

Great article, Mr. Sivers. Thank you. For some reason, it reminded me of a recent movie I saw called SUPER about a guy who got a call from God to become a vigilante superhero. At one point, his sidekick is frustrated because they're not out there fighting crime, and he tells her that maybe she just needs to be bored sometimes. She says...

LIBBY: You don't see them bored in comic books.
FRANK: That's what happens in between the panels.
LIBBY: Wow, in between the panels! Is that where we are right now?
FRANK: We could do anything here.

This journal idea sounds like a great way to get through the Between the Panels days, which in my experience, is most days. Keeping this record could be a great way to look back at the Between the Panels days and see that, in hindsight, and taken together, they were actually pretty extraordinary.

Ah HA !! I just started to grow up about my addictions, Which I never knew I had ? I suspected but because I resisted I was being so selfish. I stated going over all of the events I had been a part of that would have been far less complicated without self medicating and man...holy cow. I start each day with a prayer for peace in my brain and for peace with my loved ones. I'm so much quieter and sleeping like a 12 year old now. I'm learning to keep a journal which has given me a grounding on earth.

Joy to you my friend,

I started keeping a journal when I was nine, and I wrote my daughter a letter about it when she was nine...

“Dear Katie, When I was nine years old my mom gave me a blank journal. It was the greatest Christmas gift I had ever received, or would ever receive. I’ve kept it faithfully, and it helps me a lot. The good things are fun to look back on, and the difficult things are easier to understand once they’re in writing. Since I was little, I’ve been conscious of how short life is. It makes me sad. The journal is my way of saving my life. Until I had you, I didn’t know if there was anyone who would want to read what I’ve written. Knowing my bubbly little nine-year-old who’s having trouble falling asleep because she’s so excited for Christmas may someday find this interesting makes it more fun to work on. I hope it’s a good story! I wish I didn’t have to miss any of your story, Kate. I love you so much! Mom.”

Derek,

I always enjoy and learn from you (since Growth Hacker interview) , I also appreciate that you have answered my emails (I'm the TV repairman) (now Drone repair). I write down thoughts because I want to write two books. one on overcoming addiction (clean 30 years) one about entrepreneurship (my version of it). I am not organized , maybe what your suggested can help me better organize my thoughts and accomplish my goals .

Thanks
Eric

Thanks Derek funny timing as I am making a bunch of notebooks now - I normally use google sheets though as I like to chart it out

And your nownownow has become a bit of a journal for me as I have kept it as a public archive every Sunday I used to delete the old entries but put it as an archive instead on the bottom of the same now page - https://mikesblog.com/now/

Love this. So useful. I have something of the kind, but it's all over the place. Will get it together tomorrow! Also, I have a mothering journal that I've been writing for Noah (my son) since he was born. Every time something different, important, funny, unusual, sad, etc, happens, I write it down in letter-form for him on a file I have on Google Docs. Been going for 8 years so far and I think he'll really appreciate it in a few years.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the daily diary.

Now that I read your blog, I think I have another perspective of how to do it.
I will start today and track it in my habit tracker to build momentum.

Thank you again because I have been reading your blog and book summaries since 2017 after I got introduced to you by Tim Ferris book "Tools of Titans".

Thank you Derek. My practice has been inconsistent and messy and I'm excited to put some of this to work. Especially the "thoughts on" journals. I really appreciate the insights on regrets and on how you work out inner conflicts. I tend to want my journal to be "me," so I try to work it out before putting it down... I now see the flaw in this and how the journal can be a tool for figuring "me" out. Much of your work has impacted me, and this one struck a chord at the write time and place. Wishing you well.

Well.
I wonder if I will ignore this, from my "busy life." or humbly get back to it.

I remember in my first shared house, back in the mid1970's, three of us at once writing in our journals at the kitchen table. At that age we were sweetly sentimental about our lives.

At the time there was one—count 'em, one—book on how to keep a journal, by a woman who had gone to the (what ever we had back then) and discovered there were no books about journals. There are more now.

This was back when the students of professor Philip Zimbardo were asking him about shyness. Again, no books found, so he wrote the first one.

In time I wondered, "Can a man by taking thought add one inch to his stature?" and therefore I put up a semi-permeable membrane around my journal, writing only safe stuff.

At present my journal is, among other things, a way of being accountable to myself on a daily basis, as I can plan in the morning and write the results in the evening. Best to be realistic.

Hi Derek,

It really is the highlight of my day when I see your name in my inbox. I have been journalling for a while now as well and your mail has confirmed I'm on the right track. I heard a quote on Tim Ferriss's podcast which said 'I only know what I'm thinking once I've written it down'. I recently did a TEDx talk and found journalling was instrumental to my writing process and really helped flesh out my conflicting thoughts. I love your advice to question the initial thought - I found the goal I wrote down belonged to an old version of me and not necessarily what I want now. Only writing can provide that clarity.

Thanks for your article, always inspiring.

Have a brilliant day,
Warm wishes
Lori

I was lucky enough to go on a school cruise (certainly another time!?) around the Baltic when I was 16 and the detailed log I kept about that won me the Captain's Prize.

I was careful too to keep a diary when I went to university so that, as you say, I would not not rely on distant and embellished memories but fix that time accurately. And I've kept a diary sporadically ever since even though a lot of people are scathing about this particular habit.

Whatever else one can say about writing, it certainly helps to clear the mind. You often don't know what you really think about something until you write it down.

It's a dying art. It's the sort of activity that gets easiy squeezed out in the daily routine, replaced by mindless SMSs.

Which reminds me. I must write that blog post I was thinking about....
56. KERI (2019-01-28) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69591)

Derek, a question on “thoughts on” - do you have a separate file for each topic, or you work with tags? Sometimes thoughts fall into more than one category, such as investing+money or sex+regrets eheh.

I’ve been practicing handwriting journaling for 5 years (Cameron’s “morning pages”). And although it’s a truly healing, it’s indeed illegible most of the times.

Hope Portugal is treating you well!

Separate file for each. If there's too much crossover, like Investing+Money, then I'd just merge them into one flie. And for things really separate (Sex and Regrets, hopefully) just write about the different aspects in each. -- Derek

57. Martin (2019-01-28) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69592)

Been struggling to keep up this practice for a decade now. Mainly because I deem this too intimate to keep it in an electronic unencrypted format.

When you start a daily entry but then realise that you are mostly writing "Thoughts On", what do you do? Cut & Paste if into the "Thoughts On" journal? Leave it in the daily journal? Create a duplicate in the "Thoughs On" journal?

Smart to keep it encrypted, yes. And yeah that's a funny question, but I do that all the time. Writing in my daily diary then “Hmm… I need to add this to my ThoughtsOn/Friends.txt” (or whatever). I'll copy the chunk over to that file then dive deeper into it there, and when I switch back to daily diary write “See ThoughtsOn/Friends.txt for today.” -- Derek

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Memoires: The Diary
For Android users, search google play store, spell it correctly.

It's free, it doesn't track you or secretly glean information from your phone.
AND it lets you back up everything inside a zip drive for safe storage.
You can set the tags for your "THOUGHTS ON"

Best of all, you can record voice notes, photos.

A fun way to start our journal each night, "Hey dear, what was the best thing that happened to you today.

Buy this APP creator a cup-of-coffee after you've used it a few years.
I wish every APP served its purpose as well as this one.

NOTE: The app hasn't been updated in years, but it works perfectly on Android 9.0 on my Huawei Mate 20 X.

Unsolicited Huawei testimonial: I love the Mate 20 X! Though I bought it just to piss off a certain government that believes they have the God-given right to place their secret backdoor on our phones. It's the best phone ever! I bought mine in China -35% discount versus the international version. BONUS: Google play store services works perfectly even though Google is banned in China.

Great write up Derek!

Thank you for sharing your thoughts. I have found it very valuable to reflect by Journaling. I write in the morning after meditation and before bed every day with the 5 Minuite Journal . It is interesting to see the way that you look at the different areas of life and create categories. I also take a photo every day, this helps me remember that day in more ways and this I find very enjoyable to go back and look at.

Jim Rohn has a great book on how to Journal and recommends to write in it all the time and keep it with you so you capture all the things you learn and the moments that are meaningful to you.

My life coach gave me a task that goes like this.

Each morning when you waking up drinking your favorite beverage. Write in your journal at the beginning of your day instead of the end.

Write about your perfect day. Imagine it and put it on paper.

Want to blow your mind? At the end of the month, review your morning and evening journals. Don't be amazed if your days match whatever you wrote that morning.

Amen to Mozes' APP recommendation -- Memoires: The Diary for Android.
AWESOME APP.

Interesting. I love:

> This is important because years from now you might be looking back, wondering if you were as happy or as sad as you remember during this time.

> You can’t trust distant memories. But you can trust your daily diary. It’s the best indicator to your future self (and maybe descendants) of what was really going on in your life at this time.

Also the 'Regrets' journal.

I'm looking forward to when voice memos become easy enough to construct, save, and search that we can create an audio version of this. Or perhaps, that's a job for me to take on one day.

Thank you so much for this, Derek. I've been journaling for a few years now -- which is a long time given that I'm in my early 20s -- but I've always created a new file in my vimwiki for each day. To keep the entire diary in one file would enable me to read and review the previous entries a lot easier, which'll prove to be quite beneficial, I assume. I've also been doing themed entries which are kind of a less sophisticated way of doing "Thoughts On..." journals, so I'll start implementing those as well.

Cheers!

Ha... Once again, we haven’t talked about it before, but we both do it exactly the same way! The only difference is that I detest typing, so I keep on handwriting.

Not sure my ink will still be “something that will be readable in 50 years.”

Indeed, it’s doing a lot of good. More than we can even imagine in the first place. It feels great to write, sure, but to me, rereading it (insert period of time here) later is what matters most. I was kinda shocked by my own writings more than once, both in a positive and a negative way (knowing that we’re all wrong about plus and minus. In physics, negative charge = good, and positive charge = bad.) but in the end, it’s definitely something to do. Great idea Derek. Separating topics is also important, thanks for pointing that out.

A few years ago I did the "morning pages" journaling for a few months and then stopped. But after stopping I kept finding myself thinking about those days when I journaled every morning and how much of a difference it made with helping me think more clearly and feel less stressed. Journaling my thoughts even helped me speak to people with more clarity.

This year I've started journaling every day and plan to never stop again.

The "Thoughts On" journaling is a great idea and I will implement it into my daily journal routine today. The regrets journal is an especially good idea.

Thanks for these recommendations!

Last year I started a blog as a public daily diary, and wrote more than 160 blog entries. I stopped to take a break in December, and haven't found the inspiration to get started again. I think I just found the inspiration I needed!

I recently came across a group of people (https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge#readme) creating wikis containing everything they know (e.g., [https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz)](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz%29/) and it sounds very similar to your idea of topic journals. I was thinking of replacing my daily blog with a wiki, but after reading your article it makes a lot more sense to do both.

I, for one, would love to see what you've written under some of those headings in your topic journal. Do you think having a public diary and topic journal makes sense, or are these better kept private?

It's ideal if you can share some publicly. But I think you need the freedom to write privately without having to consider anyone else's perception of it. -- Derek

73. Fabien (2019-01-28) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69608)

I've been keeping a diary for 15+ years now. And I do regret the couple of years where I stopped keeping it, because I lost on perspective and insight doing so! (= I wasted time)

I dabble in a lot of different topics in it, too. Though I basically keep it all in one file (6.7MB of plain text!) and use a form of hashtag to keep track of the different topics.

I've found it very valuable to:

• Understand and fix past issues (family history, problems growing up.) It brings a lot of clarity -- and it's a lot cheaper than psychotherapy; probably a lot more effective too!

• Understand oneself better: our behavior, the impact of our decisions… Re-reading yourself once in a while get you lots of insight.

• Decision-making and goal tracking. e.g.: every month, I would re-assess my business goal to see how I'm going and what the next best move would be. Also helps stick to it for long-term, demanding goals.

• The memories. "A life worth living is worth recording." And there's more substance to it than to, say, Instagram pics.

And I just use it to reflect on a bunch of things and make my thinking clearer (books, people I meet, concepts…) Thinking in writing is more powerful than mere thoughts, because you get to take a step back.

In passing, I also used it for learning languages:

- Started it in my native French… but ended up switching to English, which is now my most-used language – the one in which I feel the most comfortable articulating complex ideas.

- I kept it a bit in two other languages at times. Helped me immerse myself in the language more (was harder of course, but still worth the effort.)

My tip to someone starting now would be to keep it in Markdown. And do keep it on the computer where you can *search* it (re-reading is half the insight and, after a while, it's just humongous so you'll need the ability to search.)

Journaling has been the one constant for me through the last 5 years. As someone with busy seasons on the one hand and weeks of calmer times on the other it helped me keep somekind of steady in my mind. Also on days I felt unproductive but journaled I knew at least I did something usefull.

I have some rituals in my journaling I copied from the www I'd like to share:

Morning:
I am greatfull for...
What would make today great?
Then write 2-3 lines about current readings and what to learn from them.

Evening:
3 amazing things that happened today ...
Journal of what I did and how I felt about it.
How could I have made today better?

I journal for clarity and problem-solving. I’d never ever share it with my loved ones. Journaling is very different from verbally confiding with a friend or therapist. It’s almost like the magic eight ball in providing answers and direction. While writing, clarity emerges. Yes, one’s real feelings about big subjects like careers, marriages, love, conflict, confrontation, relationships, and so forth.

Should I make a big deal about an issue, or not? Fish, or cut bait? Remain in a career or relationship? What do I fear? What action should I take? What are the risks? What’s my inner compass telling me to do? Will I do it? If not, what’s preventing me? And what are the costs of denying the raw truth uncovered by intimate journaling? If not now, when?

81. Jesse Lambert (2019-01-28) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69617)

Started writing like this at 29. Was too perfectionist to start typing on a computer, so I would go to a nearby table and journal a page a day, or try. Didn't work at first, but three years later I journal everyday on my computer multiple times, to the post where I sometimes worry if I journal too much.

I have budget journal that I update every month, a regret journal with every regret I ever had, a wishlist journal, an attention journal to manage my responses to my posted work, and back when I tried cryptocurrency trading I had a journal for that.

It's fantastic for memory as well. When I read back, I could not only see my own patterns of behavior but how similar I thought to what I think today. Painful as it might be to admit that I haven't changed as much as I would like, it's satisfying to know I have a tool to win against myself.

Thanks for sharing, Derek.

I journaled briefly when I was a teenager, going through my first love and heartbreak. It wasn't helpful. Indeed, it kept me stuck on unhealthy and obsessive thoughts I would have done better to let go of. I was never able to--until years later--look back at those journals with anything resembling the objectivity required to learn from them.

It took maybe 15 more years for me to realize I could finally journal in a healthy manner.

Journaling is not for everyone or every situation. It takes a certain amount of emotional maturity to have an accepting relationship with your past self.

But now that I've gotten to that point, I am so grateful for the ability to save my most important thoughts. And that's how I journal: a simple moleskine in my pocket and by my bed in which I record insights and feelings of the sort that don't occur every day, and which seem important to my outlook on life. It's a manageable amount of information for me.

89. Jeannie Lindsay (2019-01-28) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69625)

I’ve done this for decades too, although I’m a bit less organized. I also have done a meditation practice for more than a decade now that involves reviewing the day at the end of nightly meditation, and doing a mental “re-do” of situations I feel I could have handled better. Michael Roach describes this really well in The Diamond Cutter. It’s incredibly useful.

Also, you’re absolutely correct, you DO want to look into CBT. If you have Audible, the Satterfield Great Courses CBT module is one of the best I’ve found. I think you would love this.

Thanks for this, I’m going to borrow liberally from your suggestions.

Thank you Derek, another though provoking post. I've just started journaling since just the beginning of year and found it already incredibly helpful. It made me write about some difficult situations, which after reading back over a week later, gave me some wonderful insights which I don't think I would have realised without journaling.

I was encouraging my brother to do the same and I haven't been able to articulate why I've found it so useful in such well written terms as you've done here. So, thank you.

Perhaps a quick question (and apologies if someone has asked this in their comments below). Before I started, I was trying to figure out whether it would be better to write it in a physical diary, or on a computer. Whilst I see more merits technically for computer use (readability and able to search), I switched after the first day from the computer to writing out manually on a 'page per view' A4 diary. Although it takes a little longer, I found the whole writing process a little more cathartic. I'm always on my computer and it made a change switching to the physical form of writing and I get some pleasure from the visual form and flicking through what I've written. It's a standard, A4 page per view diary.

I just wondered whether anyone else had any thoughts on this? Whilst the central point is of course writing a journal (in whatever medium) perhaps, perhaps the chosen form may contribute to its' 'sticking' power?

Thank you once again Derek for your wonderful posts. Always such a joy to read and explore.

I used to journal, but fell out of the practice. I pick it up from time to time, but then let it go. Another inspiration to re-start and keep the flow.

Anaïs Nin's diaries had a powerful impact on my life. I had always envisioned myself keeping a record of my entire life. Then life got busy.

25 years ago I spent 3 years living on the streets, traveling around the country trying to become a famous artist. I wound up converting it into a hypertext version with different threads (Thoughts On...). If you ever feel bored, you can read it here: https://musespace.com/book/html/preface.html

Someday I'll get it published. It remains, for me, one of the most powerful sets of memories in my life.

Thank you Derek. I like the idea of having separate "thoughts on" journals. If you had to assign a "thoughts-on" label to your daily diary, what would it be? In other words, how do you distinguish between the content that goes into the daily diary and what is strictly "thoughts-on" related? In reviewing dialogue in comments, it seems like there are a few questions to this matter and you touch on it as well in a response - but it still remains a little unclear to me.

When I have a shot of inspiration (possibly from reading a tweet or hearing something profound), I'll go to my web browser (whether mobile or laptop) and type in the following URL: "docs.new" (as in [http://docs.new).](http://docs.new%29./)

This URL will automatically open up a new Google Doc for me to write down all my thoughts on the topic at hand.

Brilliant, as usual.

Very well explained.

Seems like an Idea best started 70 years ago (for me). Today will have to do.

"My People" is a concept I learned from my friend Randy Revelle, founder of Context Associated. Any chance you knew him too?

Thank you, Derek,

I know the value of journaling, or keeping a daily diary, and have done it off and on in the past. I just keep falling off the rails . You have presented an insightful plan and format for consistent tracking of thoughts and analysis. Thank you! I am starting up again!

I never thought of keeping separate journals for each thoughts. That seems WAY more organized for things that you want to come back to in the future. And the various topics that you keep track of is a great list to think about. I often have revelations about music or songwriting but I don't have a method for organizing these thoughts throughout time.

So thank you SO much for sharing this idea!

I love hearing from you! So inspiring! Oh, the cloud. I have been using Notes on my iPhone and somehow deleted my most recent. I guess it has been beyond 30 days and fear now that I cannot recover my most treasured. Another throwback belief that invisible capturing of creativity has its dangerous side to be sucked into a black hole.

You remind me of my love of The Artists Way and all of Julia Cameron’s books published by Jeremy Tharcher. We had a very long lunch with Jeremy and his wife Shari Lewis (my favorite female comedian with her puppet Lamb Chop) I grew up watching Shari. Jeremy however was a more recent discovery. I thanked him profusely for bringing Cameron’s books to the world. I think he was a bit shocked to receive so much love when Shari had been in the lime light for decades. What an amazing couple❤️ Gone too soon but remembered forever. Cameron’s Morning Pages were a life changing experience.

I like this. New insight to a practice I've held off-and-on for more than 5 - 7 years. I'm currently off it, because I found it becomes repetitive, and I don't see the "huge gains" I did when I first began. Every time I come back to it, however, I always remember why I do it.

This is cool, I'll give it a shot. Thanks Derek!

Thanks Derek for your thoughts. I've been doing a daily diary and also a picture a day for years now. I look back now and realize that some of the most mundane photos are also the most significant. Reason being, is that those photos are typically of things that I've come to accept as "normal", and in my experience, "normal" constantly changes. Anyway, thanks for your insight.

Best,

I started keeping a daily diary on my first day of college...and I haven’t missed a day since. That was in September 1980. Yes, your calculations are correct: 38 years and counting.

Daily journaling is the best! I’ve been doing it for a few years now, but have never thought of going digital until I read this. Would be much easier to always have with me and easier to reflect.

I've kept a journal on and off for the past 30 or so years. It started as an exercise in a uni course and I still use the black and white composition books.

Since then I've always thought it would help me recognize the signs of approaching depression, or mania, but those were the times I'd quit writing. It can be a good release and become a good habit, but it will always get run over by the stronger forces in your life. I wish I could have managed to write through it all, though. Memories are too unreliable whether you're bipolar or lazy or busy or a genius.

Great ideas to broaden and yet focus on what you write about. Thanks for sharing as always.

Hey Derek,

Thanks for this. I've been keeping a pocket notebook for the last two years where I track what I'm doing every 20 minutes. I deal with "Time Blindness" and have a hard time telling the difference between 5 minutes and 50 minutes depending on the activity I'm engaged in.

I've found it really helpful to keep track of what I'm actually doing with my life - not just what I say I'm doing. It also helps me have more self compassion because I can see that I put a lot of emphasis on my family over making money and that is important to me. Always trying to live my values rather than for someone else's expectations.

As a psychotherapist who is very familiar with CBT I thought I'd put a few well worn recommendations down. Please let me know if you end up reading any and what you think. :)

Hi Derek

Love this article, have been journaling daily now for 4 years and it has been extremely valuable in clearing my head and given me a better perspective on life and were I am at. The thoughts on idea sounds interesting and I will give it a go. Keeping my thoughts on a particular subject makes sense and can see value in this.

Thanks for sharing

Love this post! I have kept a journal since I was about 5. (starting with the help of my Mom.) That journal sadly is burned. Yes, I said, I burned it when I was 10 after my older brother read it with his best friend (and my crush! mortifying for a 10 year old!) Oh how I wish I still had that journal. Anyway...I have continued journaling and using better hiding places for them (I hope) during my teen years and on. Now it's helpful for my memory, making decisions, tracking habits, de-stressing, songwriting/ideas and noticing patterns with my behavior. Love the idea of separating into topics. Mine are on paper and a bit scattered with topics, but I've finally started adding an index to help me find important passages. The best thing about this Monday was seeing your email in my inbox this morning! Thank you for highlighting this topic to help reaffirm this habit.

Derek, For years I've been using an app called Cognitive Diary to aid me to process in a manner similar to what you've discribed. It has links to resources to help me get a deeper understanding & clarity when I feel the need for that. You brought up an important point about having access to a history on archive. So I checked the app setting and it does allow me to backup the data. Though I never thought to do that. I still "jot" thoughts on paper and make text notes, but I'm not nearly as organized as you are. But until now, it did not occur to me that I can actually approach the subject of "organization" in my journaling. You are so good at pointing things outs even when they are hiding in plain sight. Thanks for all you do to help others.

Sincerely,
Tina

I both admire your discipline and wonder how you can take the time to do this reflection daily. Thank you for sharing some of your findings like writing a thought you think is new but you notice you recorded it a year ago. And that we make decisions based on our beliefs of how we will feel in the future, but when reviewing entries over time there is no evidence that we will feel the way we project that we will. You are a unique and fascinating guy. I am a 63 yr old man thinking of retiring from a sales career that is unfulfilling. I want to be free to do whatever I want. And want to encourage people and mentor them to overcome fear and doubt. I feel like you are free and doing what you want and are having a fulfilling life! Awesome!

why separate files for the "thoughts on"? seems like one massive file would be way way better for searching later...I made ONE .txt file and copied all your thoughts-on categories as headers for each set of thoughts. Your categories are excellent. love it.

What a great share Derek. I really loved it. I keep my diaries the old fashioned way- in hard copies bound in beautiful covers that I store away. I have diaries going back to high school; a long time ago.. One day I discovered those by mistake and starting reading them. I was in my 30s at the time. I had to ask myself who is this person? The tone of voice was like someone else completely.

You sound very organized on this topic. I am not so much. Rather I write down my thoughts and dreams, hope and desires, emotions and perceptions in a more general way.

I like the idea of sorting these out by topic.
All the best,

I made a big change in my life after starting a diary.
Started it by asking "Who I am?"... and answering.
"What I am after?"
"What do I have now?"
"Is what I am doing taking me closer to what I am/want?"

Hey Derek,

Thank you for posting this. Useful indeed!

I meant to journal for a while and your post made me start today. If it brought you so much value, I’ll just do it for half a year at first and see whether I’ll feel the same.

Did my first entry after reading your post about a situation that happened just beforehand. It had a relationship component. In such a case, where your daily diary touches topics you have a separate journal on: do you take those thoughts over to that journal as well? Or do you just search your diary in addition to the journal, if you’re looking for something particular?

Yes, if in my daily diary I start writing about a subject I have a journal on, or should, I'll copy it over there and elaborate in that journal. (Then in my daily diary usually say “go see ThoughtsOn/NewZealand.txt for today”) -- Derek

Derek--

I like the idea of a daily journal but it is difficult to discipline oneself to do it every day (or even the next day). I have attempted it once or twice in the past and it seemed more like a chore I had to do rather than a true expression of what I was feeling. I have revisited many of the songs I have written over the last 40 years and they do provide great insight into what I was feeling at the time. From high school anger at my parents about something silly or longing for a pretty girl in class (that I never had the guts to ask for a date :) The stressful times in my life where I overcame hardship or grief. These I was able to express in song and lyrics. I even amaze myself how "deep" I was on some things at a very young age or a moral stand that I still am content with in my later years. There are songs of love for every girl I dated (and married) over the years as well as The Girl I Never Knew. In reading these song lyrics I do enjoy knowing what I was thinking and feeling at the time. So, in a way, I can say that my "Song Journals" has been a similar concept of examination and reflection that I truly value after all these years. RC

This came at the optimal time. I've used a journal before and found it helpful, but it felt too much like a chore like I was pressuring myself to write too much. This way seems much simpler, thoughtful, useful and sustainable. One suggestion is perhaps to use an app or software that is more helpful to organize the journal (I don't want fifty wordpad files) but then back it up to plain text.

This came at the most opportune time. I had been invited to become a coach for Tony Robbins and had been anticipating my start date of February 4th. However, this morning I open the email from the organization and was told that the next coaches Academy wouldn't begin until the end of May. Of course, I had already scheduled rooms, food, and other ancillary things in order to participate for 10 days in Los Angeles at Unleash the Power Within. Needless to say, I was mightily disappointed!

Now, after reading your brief email I am sitting down late in the afternoon at a very unusual time for me since I generally write in my journal as part of my morning routine after waking, and I will take your guidance and make some notes to myself, share my feelings and thoughts, and get clear on what my next step will be.

Thanks for sharing, Derek. Your schedule (writing a bit each night, and making it up the following morning if you miss a night) sounds good to me, so I'll give it a try.

This part especially resonated with me: "Sometimes I think I have a new thought on a subject, so I open up the file and write it down, then afterwards I see I had that same thought a year ago and had forgotten about it. If you care about your thoughts, keep them."

I've done this before too, and it always humbles me to relearn that I forget my thoughts, even those I thought important enough to write down, and I forget them so completely that I don't even recognize them when I read them later.

Interesting and enjoyable. You are much more organized and structured than I and I admire that.

I keep files on many similar topics but rarely write in them.

I do journal daily and my journal is more of an intention setting tool.

My first entry is a stoic quote of the day.

My second is 3 things I am grateful for.

Third are the 5 pillars of my life philosophy which are

Amour fati- (embrace everything )

Be impeccable
Take nothing personally
Don’t jump to conclusions
Always do my best

I close it off w 5 Spanish phrases I am committing to memory.

I find that by writing every morning I set the tone for the day which in turn sets the tone for weeks, months and years.

Thats so awesome!

I started writing a title for the day right next to date and time. It's not supposed to be a "big thing", or to make it seem like every day deserves a title like a book or movie. It's just a way to think about a remarkable event in the day, something that stuck with me. Only after doing this for a while I noticed that forcing myself to summon the day in one short sentence has become a powerful habit.

It's always fun to glance at the day's titles. It's for me only, it wouldn't make much sense to others, but I think it has been a positive discovery, and it's my 2 cents to you!

Hah, so surprised to see this land in my mailbox since coincidentally I've been working on an Android app which is specifically for that "Ask yourself questions, then question your answers." purpose. It's at customjournalapp.com

I truly believe that in the future we are going to think about mental exercise (yoga, walking in the woods, journaling, meditation, etc.) similar to how we think about going to the gym (or exercise in general) now.

Instead of asking if you've been working out (or suggesting that you should). They will say "hey, you look like you need to take a mental break, go for some meditation or a media cleanse". Journaling is an excellent way to reflect and "work out the mind"

for me it works only as a mind purification. Just imagine the volume of the notes you accumulate after 10 years, are you going to re-read each note at least once in your lifetime? please share more of your experiences for reviewing your past notes.

Thank you!

Just when I need to. Reflecting back on a relationship, for example. Was I as happy as I remember? I go back and read the daily entries. It's often surprisingly different from my memories. Or if I'm thinking on a subject like investing or getting a dog, I go back and look at all my past thoughts on it, looking for consistency or not. -- Derek

Wow, this is Great. I think I have three Journals, that sit by my bed. I rarely take time to write my thoughts. I set many Goals, and have Accomplished more of them, then I ever thought I would; at 56.

Your e-mail is an inspiration, to make time; just do it.

Thank you for this Derek! You articles always seem perfectly timed to inform something I am grappling with.

I have kept a journal of random thoughts intermittently for years on paper. At the end of last year I started keeping a daily journal on stoic principles, by anticipating challenges for the approaching day, asking myself how I may best behave in the situation then later reviewing the successes/failures of the day. This was useful. I agree that questioning helps clarity and personal growth.

It's easy for me to become very outcome driven so I decided this year to let go of outcome goals, focus on processes and clarify my values.

I like the idea of the categorised thoughts journal and reviewing the thoughts later. I imagine I would have more thoughts on my highest values and so this will help me identify these and observe how they evolve over time.

I think it is time to go at least partly digital! Thank you

Thoughts on regrets is a wonderful idea,thank you.

Btw, yes, it's really frustrating to have some sort of epiphany on a subject and then realize you had it already years ago and forgot about it. It happens to me on a regular basis. :/

I've been keeping a diary habit for about two years and then I've stopped.

I never questioned this decision, up until today.

Now I understand what I've been doing wrong - I've been writing each Morning. I wrote about what I felt like (mostly), and what I want to do/achieve throughout the day.

But evening journals seem far more interesting now when I think about them.

I'll have a lot of things to reflect on, and the journal will be far more than the usual "I feel optimistic this morning..."

Dwelling on feelings is great, sure, but much more so when they're incorporated into a larger whole - otherwise, it's just trying too hard to write about how you feel.

Thank you for this!

I have always wanted to journal but never gotten around to it. I will now change that. I would love to be able to read what my thoughts were 10 years ago, especially when I feel more and more that memory cannot be entirely trusted, and not to mention all the moments lost in time which I would have liked to read and learn from now.

Hello Derek,

Writing in journals for over 30 years has been incredibly helpful.

Sometimes I go back and read one, and realize my memory was completely different than what I wrote.

Question on what you wrote:

First, you wrote some of your questions here:

“...I ask myself what I hope to get out of it, why, and whether there are other ways to get what I want.”

(Very helpful)

Then you wrote:

“I answer with my initial thought first, but then question it with skepticism and consider different perspectives.”

Could you help me understand better what you mean by ‘question it with skepticism’ and share some of those questions and/or an example of the skepticism?

I appreciate you.

Have an excellent day.

Hello Derek, brilliant post as always.

Paper vs digital. If using digital, or thinking about switching, how do you suggest we separate the "thoughts on Journal"? For example, one word document for a normal everyday journa, and then separate words docs for the diff topics?

Thanks

Hi Derek,

Thanks for a great article again. I really appreciate your work, you are one of only a few people in the cyberspace that have inspired my path and way of life quite a lot. Just to note, I am a software developer, musician, and author, so I find so much in your writings.

I just wanted to share with you that after 12 years of daily journaling I've also found a very simple and effective system, and a few months ago I've turned it into a free journaling app for Mac called Reflection. If you'd be interested to check it out, please visit my website https://jocius.net/reflection or use this App Store link directly:

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reflection-personal-journal/id1441459828

It resonated with me so much when you mentioned keeping everything in plain text format when using digital journals. My app does exactly that, it is designed to keep all journals for decades by storing everything in Markdown format, directly in the file system.

Thanks again and best wishes!

Martynas

I daily journal in the morning, and it's amazing how my memory works. I forget huge chunks of time, but when I read about a day years ago and I almost put myself in that day as if it was yesterday. I am going to start using the 'Thoughts On' suggestion, but I use Evernote now. I would like to use .txt; however, I also like to easily search. 'What was the name of that restaurant, we went to with our neighbors?'....the simple search helps my memory too.

172. Dylan (2019-01-29) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69712)

What if you read books and listen to podcasts on one of your writing topics? Do you ever add some of your book notes to your “thoughts on” subject notes — if they’re on the same topic? Or are they best kept separate?

Very often! “Read an interesting idea in a book today, about _____. That got me thinking…” then I continue from there. -- Derek

173. George (2019-01-29) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69714)

The "Thoughts On…" text files is a great idea/solution. Essentially, like a blog category. Instantly adopted into my plain-text journaling system. Seems so obvious in hindsight.

Regarding daily journaling, after many years of fussing with various daily journal solutions, I discovered one that works great, with some slight modifications I've made. I've shared the details on my blog:

https://georgecoghill.wordpress.com/2018/01/01/the-one-line-per-day-one-page-plain-text-daily-journal/

Essentially, a single text file, with one line per day summarizing the significant events of the day (even the mundane events). The key is that it's designed with Future You in mind as the reader, rather than Present You as the writer. Easily skimmable, easy to grasp context of a range of time.

My post goes into plenty of detail on it all, including some great apps: check out both the 1Writer and Drafts apps on iOS, as well as the nvALT app on macOS. Perfect for this sort of plain-text journaling.

Great post! When it comes to lots of notes on lots of topics, I remain a fan of programs like Notational Velocity (http://notational.net/) because of "Incremental Search." If you find yourself spending more than a few seconds to find a topic or something you recall writing about previously, this solves that problem. Having kept this collection of text files for years, I've lost count of how many I have but it really doesn't matter. I can keep making more or increasingly, combining existing ones to make less.

178. Aleix Ramon (2019-01-30) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69724)
About asking yourself questions when feeling conficted:

There's an intriguing method of dealing with internal conflict. Imagine the personification of each side of the conflict and let them have a discussion (eg the "you" that wants to travel vs. the "you" that wants to be sedentary).

I've found out it feels surprisingly good. It lets you solve inner problems without the feeling of being judged by yourself because you become a simple spectator instead of the victim.

Derek,

I love the idea of journaling and note taking. It propels me into something which I naturally do (excessively) already.

2 things I've been struggling with about journaling:

. it seems to me that note taking makes me less mindful in general and changes the way I experience life. E.g. when I read about a great concept in a book and instead of enjoying the book and maybe further elaborations of the concept I interrupt my flow of reading to take a note. The same thing happens when I experience something noteworthy in real life. I immediately think: "Oh, I have to write this down later". Like in Quantum Mechanics, the fact that I'm taking notes changes the way I experience things and how I interact with my environment. Do you sometimes also struggle to find the balance between taking notes and being mindful about the current moment and just enjoying it?

. I find that my latticework of thinking models (thanks Charlie Munger) progresses over time. Therefore thoughts I had some time ago simply don't matter anymore to me today because I had a more limited choice of models to think about a problem. When I read about older thoughts I'm proud that I have developed in the meantime but I can't solve current problems, conflicts with past solutions. So isn't it therefore better to document the outlines of my thinking models and update them once a month instead of writing down raw thoughts?

Would love to hear your thoughts on my thoughts.

Thanks for putting great content out!

Manfred

Hi Derek!

Long time no see! But since reading this brilliant article, it doesn't feel like that long anymore :)

About writing a diary, I know it's helped me greatly in the past, specifically asking questions, answering and then questioning again.. but I have found that sometimes it's really hard to do that - the digging deep and it often stops me from consistently keeping the habit of daily writing. I'm trying to tell myself, just 10 minutes a day and since I've just told you that, I'll make sure I do some tonight! But generally, do you have any tips/another article about how to be consistent with habits, especially when they're things you don't really like to do at times but know they're good for you?

Thanks again for writing such a brilliant and validating (the importance of daily writing) article, I hope to see you guys again soon!!

Thank you for the idea of grouping thoughts based on the topics.
This horizontal scaling will improve my efforts greately!

I have small input from me regarding tools, you are spot on on the topic of using as basic system for note taking as possible, plain text text files are my choise as well.

Regarding archivisation there is a very good protocol designed for software engineering called git. Quite famous implemention being -> [https://github.com/.](https://github.com/)

It allows you to synchronise your files, from local machine, to very poweful infrastruture of Git for free in a private manner.

The interface is easy to learn for basic usage.

I would ask a friendly programmer from your environment, explain the needs, and train it with her/him. This way you are buying into very powerful tool which will be here as long as software is produced.

Derek, do you ever think/worry about who else might read your personal journals either now or some day down the road? Do you sensor your thoughts a bit because of this? I noticed you have ‘Carla’ as a topic. If you want to vent about her, (for example) do you worry she will see it and then vent less? On a side note, my mom has written religiously in a diary EVERY day since 1975 and now has volumes! She says she wants to burn the all before she passes away and they fall into the wrong hands. I hope she does not.

Great post and thanks again for sharing. I really like the idea of specific “thoughts on” journals as a way to better catalog your thoughts and keep building each topic. I like the idea of tracking regrets as well. I’ve heard other people do something similar with keeping life resolutions based on those regrets.

I’ve been journaling for the past 10 years or so on pen and paper on about a weekly basis. I’ll usualky fill up a moleskin journal each year and then go back and read it over at the end of the year to identify patterns, insights, etc. A lot of times, when I didn’t have anything specific to write about, it has a similar benefit to meditation in that it slows things down and keeps you in the moment. Agree with what you said about the additional benefits for emotional and intellectual development for sure.

May have to experiment a little with bringing my journal from paper to the digital side. Both are fun. Thanks again for sharing!

Hi Derek,

Great post. Someone else recommended ahhlife, I use [http://dabble.me](http://dabble.me/) which is also an offspring of ohlife, which closed. (Ohlife did give plenty of notice for backing up and migrating, fwiw.)

One of my favorite features of the model is the automatic surfacing of prior entries:

> 1 year ago you wrote this...

I started journaling on their website so that I could see 1, 2, 3, ... years ago.

Suggestion: You might experiment with some programmatic surfacing of prior entries. When I was thinking about it, I thought that maybe 4 weeks, 8 weeks, ... 52 weeks would be interesting. (Noticing similar days of the week was pretty helpful.)

Question: what do you think about trying to avoid screens in the time before sleep? I've been trying to do that and I feel like it helps improve my sleep a bit. Maybe move the journaling to the end of my workday? I suppose it's a tradeoff, if it relieves the pressure of thoughts in your head, those can disrupt sleep as well. If willing to take the time, maybe write out at night, and then type up in the morning.

195. Le Passager (2019-01-31) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69747)

I've practiced journaling on and off for close to 20 years. It has been a therapy and it's helped me think. I love your idea of having one ThoughtsOn file per subject. I have a question and a suggestion:

Question: how to edit my files from a phone, for example when I'm outside? How did you do it at the airport. I'm using a Swiss DropBox-like (pCloud) to store my text files.

Suggestion: when writing daily, write about 3 things.

1) Lesson learned: something you have learned this day. This is a way to invite the beginner's mind

2) Magic moment: think about an event, a moment that was magical. It does not need to be big, quite the contrary. This is a way to see the magic in your everyday life and away from believing that it must be big stuff

3) Personal victory: think about something you did or didn't do, a moment when you said yes or no, you stopped something fruitless of started something useful. This is way to go toward self-validation and away from the search of public appraisal.

Hi Derek, I really enjoyed this. I have strugglled with maintaining the habit of journaling in the past for various reasons. I’m fairly good about building to-do lists when I’m feeling overwhelmed but haven’t made good use of journaling per se to date. Based on your advice I think I’d benefit greatly from keeping a “Thoughts on” journal. I think about A LOT and those thoughts are not always linked. Is there a software you prefer for keeping Thoughs on journals? Or, Do you simply create a folder for each topic in your computer files? I look forward to your response. Thank you.

Ps: I read from your book notes often and recommend them even more frequently. They’re incredibly resourceful for brushing up on past reads or finding new ones. I hope you continue to share them. :)

It seems to me that if a young (or not so young) man or woman (or other) wants to someday "pull a Derek" by being smart enough to post on a blog, then a good place to start would be a journal. (Or maybe a blog)

If like me you are an "oral learner" then you could talk with folks, and then go home and write it down, saying it silently, and by doing so nail new thoughts down.

And hey, to answer a commenter above, I myself don't panic about capturing every thought that flies by (but if I did then I would carry small file cards in my pocket) because when I journal I am in an altered musing state, and thoughts that had flown by earlier fly back to me again.

201. Maureen Anderson (2019-02-02) [#](https://sivers.org/dj#comment-69755)

I keep thinking of this post, Derek. I've always wondered how keeping a journal has changed my life. Is it a better story for remembering the pen is my hands, as they say? Here's hoping!

I think of my blog posts as a journal entries, but with a point -- to be useful. Which has, in turn, made the journal entries veer toward what will be useful to look back on -- things I've learned, and so much laughter. Which eventually meant so often skipping the journal and going STB, "straight to blog." If it's helpful to me, it might help someone else. Here's hoping!

Given how many different places I share stories -- in letters, in the blog, on my radio show, on Twitter, and so on -- I think I'd go crazy with the different versions of a journal being discussed in the comments. So in case it helps someone else, I just date journal entries and leave it at that -- almost the way you'd file snapshots by date.

And finally, a journal becomes such a treasure chest! A while back we started sharing our daughter's best one-liners on Twitter as #TheKaOfKatie. I can report with just this one hobby, our family's probably exceeded our lifetime quota for laughs. Katie was in college when we started it, and she approves everything we post. We often then quote those lines back to each other for months! It makes us appreciate even more the fun we've had.

I could write a book, eh? But for now I'll give you the comments section back.

Thanks, Derek!

Don't use the cloud? Admittedly, I run a cloud consulting practice, but...the cloud has a level of availability and reliability that you can never, ever match at home. If you really want to archive your notes - print on acid free paper, seal in a air free package. Keep out of sunlight in a safe place that won't let them get stolen, burn in a fire and you won't forget.

There are a number of free cloud options for things like this. Odds are that one or more will either fail or get bought. Use a variety of these options to lower the risk. Your objective is to avoid the single point of failure. Storing this at home on a spinning hard drive, SSD or flash drive is not going to avoid that risk.

Hi Derek, thank you for your post. I also tried to use topic journals to capture my ideas. I found out, that I am good at generating ideas, but not so good at organizing and revisiting them. So I had a lot of subfolders and double entries. Do you also have subfolders in your categories and do you have any system to stay organized? Thank you and greets from Germany.

Thanks for sharing this! I love the idea, although it sounds a bit intimidating from consistency perspective.

I read Rich's comments on electronic vs paper, and I have some follow up questions. You said plain text file, so do you just open it plain in some text editor, or is there still a special app you use for this? As far as saving goes, you mentioned no cloud, so do you just have one external hard drive that you constantly update with these diaries? Thanks again for sharing, and if you have any other insight or recommendations for tips to get started, I would very much appreciate them!

I've been keeping a journal for over a decade, with the exception of a few dry spells. One lasting a year, another lasting months. I very much regret not continuing during those times, the reason being stress and work. But that's when it would've been most helpful in retrospect. So learning from how I feel about the times in my life I can't accurately reflect on, has only furthered my efforts to journal.

I like your idea of the "Thoughts on..." I recently added a "One Thing" to write down at least one takeaway that I've had after reading a book, listening to a podcast, or a night out with friends. I heard that idea on a podcast and have taken to it.

Thanks for the email, Derek. They are always useful.

Thanks Derek, great read. How do you organize your main journal? 1 big honking text file with 20 years of thoughts in it, or do you split it up somehow? Also, do you use any specific search tool to search across files, or just what your OS provides?

Actually I keep every day in its own separate text file, named YYYY-MM-DD.txt but I'm weird like that. I use grep [in the shell](https://sivers.org/openbsd). -- Derek

I have operated a text-file journal continuously for 25 years, that I call the "log file". It began as a method to file information I learned into a single go-to place. The information is either contained within the single file or the file contains a pointer to another file or web page. I enter terse text that grows the file size at a rate of one megabyte per year. I record interesting info and ideas on post-its while I am away, and transcribe into the log file when I return to my computer. I also record future activities in the same file, and fill in details when a future date becomes the present date.

The information helps me make mental connections, and facilitates a deeper understanding and much more complete recollection of topics. I frequently search the log file in order to clarify recollection of past events. At age 67, I observe that the log file shows the reality of the passage of time, compared with seeming to pass more slowly. My theory is: the older brain forgets past activity, which compresses my conscious memory.

I note this is comment number 222, which is my favorite number!

Hi sir, I would just like to briefly thank you for making this and posting it on Twitter. By some strange coincidence today I found that my phone s calendar has a feature which will set time aside each week for you to do certain task's. I happened to put in 'write journal' as I am fond of reading/writing but find little occasion to do the latter. Then I happened out of pure boredom decided to search twitter for people with the surname sivers(3 including me and you) where I came across your profile and accidentally clicked this link. I found it very helpful and it inspired me to write about more than I'd originally thought so thank you!

In "The Black Swan" Taleb had a comment that history books always distort information because writers are corrupted by their knowledge of the outcome. If you want to know how the events have really happened read contemporary journalists. He was referring to the work of a World War II journalist, before he got edited.

With your journal you are your own journalist. Thank you for helping me to make this connection.

Great points! I do keep a diary but it’s not a daily or even weekly ritual. I write in it whenever I feel like it- when something significant has happened or when I simply want to dump my thoughts or make an important decision. But after reading this I feel motivated to make my diary writing more regular

Just curious, do you use a digital diary or a physical one?

Thanks for posting this advice about keeping a journal. I've always wanted to but never had the discipline to keep it up. (Then there was the formatting, handwriting, storage, structure - mechanics of it that overtook the doing it.)

I love the 'Thoughts on' list. THat's like something I would do - exhaust the territory then eval the list for pearls.

Thanks too for the Bo Peabody article (what brought me here.) I tell an entrepreneurship class I teach about it and put the 'would you rather be lucky or smart' question on one of the quizzes. (Every student gets it wrong - it generates quite a conversation!) I frankly forgot some of what you wrote down. I'll add more to my quiz to make is seem more thoughtful and rational. Bo must really be a smart guy :)

Great post! I have a bunch of old docs that aren't organized by topic, but wish I could get them that way!

Though you recommend plain text, I am building a platform designed to merge journaling and goal tracking, so it handles this pretty well (it's called WeAchieve - www.weachieve.io). I setup a "Thoughts On" activity that can then have any number of note fields on the various topics that I can add to whenever - from web or iOS app.

Sorry if this seems like an ad - just a founder trying to build software to help people achieve more. Plus, it's fully free, so hopefully it's more of a PSA ☺

I've kept a diary since my aunt and uncle gave me a

lock and key one around age 6. There are so many times I wish I had someone to talk to - and my faithful journal is always there! I write my hopes!dreams and I do a lot of processing and problem solving there.

Hey Derek,
Read today's Daily Stoic and clicked through to reread your article.

Was impressed by your practice/methods when I first read it and then again today, such that I set up a file and plain text docs to start today. The thoughts-on & questions sound especially helpful.

I've kept a daily sketch-note journal for the last 10 years. It's to remember but also because I love lettering - words/letters as drawing/graphic/images. I'll always do this and this digital practice will be a good one too. Thank you for writing. Trust all is well and you're settling into life in England. -S

I started last year and found I went into an area of my life I had built a false narrative around - my marriage and my relationship with my wife. In starting the journal I started to peel back the falsehoods that I was living through. It gave me the strength to address these issues and now I am not in that marriage, I've started a new life and feel I am on the journey to becoming me for the first time ever. Sadly, I put the journal aside as it was very painful and opened the wounds I had been living with for years. I chickened out - I am buying a new journal next week (not today as I am sick with a nasty cold, otherwise I would be at the shops) and will start again and make a daily journal my habit going forward. I like the physical act of writing, and will buy a few- one for the main subject of my life and another for the extra subjects. Thank you Derek. I hope Oxford is working out for you. Regards. Phil

I appreciate the idea of a text file, but I began mine as a google doc called "Mem," which lives on my Firefox bookmarks toolbar. Then I can just click on it from any platform. A text file could get lost, or I could not have access to it. Aside: Years ago I tried to create a mindmap of all my hyperlinks, which had become chaotic. It was an interesting exercise, but by the time I had organized an old set of links in the mindmap they had lost immediacy for me.

Thank you so much for sharing this Derek! The pressures of life and the constant noise around us these days makes it hard for me to keep all my thoughts straight anymore. I like thinking through big problems but have been feeling overwhelmed.

I've started physical journals (bullet journal since that's what everyone else does), but I find that it's sometimes limiting to my expansive imagination and thoughts. I like your approach of keeping separate topics to file away so that as thoughts come in, there is a place to put them. Almost like Marie Kondo-ing of the mind. I like this system as a way of being able to know instinctively what to do with your thoughts as they come up.

I also love this line of questioning you mentioned. I've been doing that as well lately and I've gotten used to the fact that it sometimes feels like I'm just talking to myself -- but who better to have intellectual conversations with if no one is around?! :)

I would love any tips on how you do this across devices (e.g. if you don't have a computer with you). What is a system for having text files that's shared across devices so it's accessible on mobile and desktop? If you have any pro tips, I'd love to hear it! Otherwise, I suppose I can take notes on the phone then port it over to my computer as a text file later.

Thanks so much again for sharing this system!

Thanks.

Hand written journals are important to me. Penmanship says as much as what I'm writing sometimes.

A personal daily is a hard schedule to keep.

Work is a different story. Work journals have been highly useful - pay recovery, defending against predatory manager reviews, pay justification, and in general just keeping track of time, details, interruptions, meeting notes, flyby requests, and more.

Regarding formats changing - that's why I still use a camcorder with tape instead of digital. Some digital movie content cannot even be viewed anymore because the codec is simply lost, unsupported, the software unavailable, or whatever. I have digital tape from 15+ years ago in fine shape, but cannot same the same for all the digital movies.

How I handle this topic - the story is to long for a comment.

To the iPhone / iPad users. There are apps out there, the problem is, you are not independent from the developer. To use Notes or the Reminder app from Apple works but then things are not private as it is synced using iCloud. To keep things in plain text the app Textastic is a way - it is basically a payed code editor but provides plain text. The most problem is, you can't link plain text and pictures (why should a modern digital diary / journal not contain pics or movies). In this context another interesting point is, that many people already run their life journal on Twitter / Facebook.

Awesome article and tons of great comments! I love me some plain text and have been slowly trying to move away from "vendor lock-in" with things like Evernote, various to-do apps, and various cloud services.

So, I saw where you answered a question with:

"Hell no. I write offline, intentionally no WiFi on my laptop, in plain text files only. No companies, no cloud, no services needed. -- Derek"

First of all... NO WIFI?? How the hell do you survive without constant access to the Internet?? LOL!

Anyway, further down you mentioned you back up to a couple servers in different countries. Is your backup strategy home-grown or do you use an actual cloud-based backup service?

This is my biggest concern with getting away from cloud storage. I use two laptops and two phones (work and personal/business). I like to be able to access everything from all devices and keep everything in sync. Kinda hard to do without the cloud. There are things like Synchthing I've been playing with, but it's certainly not as convenient or easy to use as the likes of Dropbox or Google Drive.

I just use rsync (the built-in unix command) to backup to my different servers I've set up around the world. So yeah, home grown. But the biggest thing is I don't try to sync between devices. I only use my phone for talk/text/maps. I do all my writing and important stuff on one unix computer. -- Derek

Journalling was how I gathered "data" to justify to myself that I had to leave my marriage. For days and months and years I had a recorded-in-real-time log that provided me an accurate narrative about the relationship and its progression. It was indeed the best choice.

So yes. Regular "data collection" about oneself is invaluable. I second this suggestion. :)

Hi Derek,

one of my best friends is reflecting all the time. In fact, at the age of 73, he is still not over his childhood, with no plans for any tomorrow. Me on the other hand keep myself so busy every day, that I hardly give my past a second thought. Though I have to admit, after becoming a father almost eight years ago (I‘m 66 years by now), watching my daughter grow physically and mentally brings back memories of my own childhood, that were lost, (or so I thought). Maybe it‘s time, to do what I did a long time ago: write down little bits and pieces of my daily or at least weekly doings and thinking.

It would be the right thing to do, I think. So thanks for sharing your thoughts on this subject

Have a great time in Oxford

I am new to your blog. It has been a wonderful discovery.I liked your this post a lot, particularly, the idea of "Thoughts On". This is something I will definitely try in the near future.

You should write daily because it's the best way to look back at this time in your life. Then you'll know what you were most often experiencing. Bored? Frustrated? Satisfied? Etc. As for book notes, [see this](https://sivers.org/bfaq). -- Derek

I've been keeping a journal for 18 years now. I have a few dedicated files for specific subjects, but I tend not to create very many of them. Instead, I sprinkle tags within [...] throughout my notes. This allows a note to be cross-filed, which is occasionally useful. More usefully, I only create a dedicated file when I find myself searching for a specific tag a few times. Tags seem to lie, in a deep way, at the intersection of chronological (blog) and topic-oriented (wiki) organization, and they help me avoid agonizing over what file to write something in. Often I don't know ahead of time what I'm writing about. The tag shows up halfway through, or a year later.

I have come to prefer paper due to the several computers over time and not knowing how to collect all my stuff in a good way. Plus things disappear and I am very physically focused and want to know where things are and can put my hand out and touch something. My children would have a hard time sorting out all that I have written either in the cloud or various hard drives where I had someone help me preserve things. Nothing lasts but I write for my future self not my children and I need to find things easily and I am happy most with papers. Your words have helped me immensely, much love to you always.
