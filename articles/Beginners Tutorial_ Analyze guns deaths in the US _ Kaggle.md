Excellent getting started Notebook!

As you pointed out, suicides for White Males is very high around age 50. In my opinion, that has had a huge impact. These WOGS (White Older Guys committing Suicide) show something about the psychology of a large body of Americans -- they have lost hope. And I think it's because of decreased economic possibilities.

Long before Trump was even elected to the Republican party, it seemed to me, people in this group were identifying strongly with him to shake things up. I think the way a lot of institutions did projections on political outcomes for candidates is incomplete, unless you consider CDC data. Suicide is such a strong emotional response. It's not something that can be faked. It has to be considered. Especially, if it's centered around a particular group, which it appears to be?

Anyway...that's one reason why I think this data is so important to study. I think you'll also see an increase in Auto Accidents for this group as well.

Thanks Mike! It is interesting. I wish I had a more recent data set. I will look into Auto Accidents in the US as soon as I can. I will definitely notice the race-age as a combined feature while building my prediction model.
