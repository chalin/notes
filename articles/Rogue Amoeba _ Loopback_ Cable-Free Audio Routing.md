## Cable-free audio routing for Mac

It's easy to pass audio between applications on your Mac, with the power of Loopback. Create virtual audio devices to take the sound from apps and audio input devices, then pass it to any audio processing software. With an easy-to-use wire-based interface, Loopback gives you the power of a high-end studio mixing board, right inside your computer!

## A Transit System For Your Audio

#### Combine Audio Sources

Pull audio from multiple sources into one virtual device! Just add the applications and physical audio devices you want to include to the Sources column to get started.

#### Powerful Channel Options

Add as many output channels as needed, then configure your routing with easy and powerful virtual wiring. Customizing exactly where audio flows is a snap.

#### Pass-Thru, Too

A Pass-Thru device let you pass audio directly from one application to another, with almost no configuration required. Loopback pipes audio around for you.

## Virtual Devices Are Available to All Apps, System-Wide

#### Skype

## Great uses for Loopback

![use-podcast-guests@2x.png](../_resources/32db423383e19c3e6364309f4c18fa1c.png)

#### Play Music And More to Podcast Guests

Combine your mic with audio sources like iTunes or [Farrago](https://rogueamoeba.com/farrago), then select your Loopback device as your source in Skype. Presto! Your guests hear both your voice and your audio add-ons.

![use-combine-devices@2x.png](../_resources/dceaf7feca6c590f4eb66ba626cbd908.png)

#### Turn Multiple Hardware Devices Into One

Apps like GarageBand, Logic, and Ableton Live are limited to recording from just one audio device at a time. Thanks to Loopback, you can combine multiple input devices into a single virtual device, to record all your audio.

![use-screencast@2x.png](../_resources/03ae6928c0be22e7e08b563f382dfe33.png)

#### Create Top-Notch Screencasts

Most screen recorders allow you to include your mic's audio, and some may allow recording of system audio, but neither option is ideal. Instead create a virtual device that grabs your mic and the app’s audio to get exactly the audio you want.

![use-gameplay@2x.png](../_resources/67a7f4e088503817d42f47072bdccb9a.png)

#### Record Gameplay Videos

Making gameplay videos with great audio doesn't have to be difficult. Use Loopback with devices like Elgato's [Game Capture](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming) hardware to record both your microphone and the game's audio at once!

![use-audio-hijack@2x.png](../_resources/723bd59db03a309e1bfecdded6640cd5.png)

#### Pairs Well With Audio Hijack

Make a simple Pass-Thru device in Loopback, then set it as the *output* on the end of any [Audio Hijack](https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/) chain. Now, you can select that source as the *input* in any app to have it receive that audio.

#### So Much More…

Loopback gives you incredible power and control over how audio is routed around your Mac and between applications. We can't wait to hear about the incredible new uses you find for it!

#### Multi-channel Audio

Your virtual audio devices can be configured to have up to 64 channels, providing tremendous power.

![feature-channel-mapping@2x.png](../_resources/cf8413e1778e63d623297047ab942789.png)

#### Custom Channel Mapping

Loopback will configure a default channel mapping automatically. If you want to manually configure things, though, you’ve got full control.
