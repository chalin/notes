Advanced asyncio: Solving Real-world Production Problems

# Advanced asyncio: Solving Real-world Production Problems

Everyone’s talking about it. Everyone’s using it. But most likely, they’re doing it wrong, just like we did.

By building a simplified chaos monkey service, we will walk through how to create a good foundation for an asyncio-based service, including graceful shutdowns, proper exception handling, and testing asynchronous code. We’ll get into the hairier topics as well, covering topics like working with synchronous code, debugging and profiling, and working with threaded code. We’ll learn how to approach asynchronous and concurrent programming with Python’s asyncio library, take away some best practices, and learn what pitfalls to avoid.
