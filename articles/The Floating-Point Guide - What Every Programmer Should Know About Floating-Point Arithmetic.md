# Why don’t my numbers add up?

So you’ve written some absurdly simple code, say for example:

		0.1 + 0.2

and got a really unexpected result:

		0.30000000000000004

Maybe you asked for help on some forum and got pointed to a [long article with lots of formulas](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html) that didn’t seem to help with your problem.

Well, this site is here to:

- Explain concisely why you get that unexpected result

- Tell you how to deal with this problem

- If you’re interested, provide in-depth explanations of why floating-point numbers have to work like that and what other problems can arise

You should look at the [Basic Answers](https://floating-point-gui.de/basic/) first - but don’t stop there!
