For students and others interested in expanding their knowledge of AI during this period, we thought it might be helpful to ask our researchers what they consider to be the most impactful and insightful resources available to use [#AtHomeWithAI](https://threadreaderapp.com/hashtag/AtHomeWithAI) (1/9)**

Today’s suggestions are from research scientist Feryal Behbahani [@FeryalMP](https://twitter.com/FeryalMP)! [#AtHomeWithAI](https://threadreaderapp.com/hashtag/AtHomeWithAI)  [![EXVoprXUMAIX7XE.jpg](../_resources/adecd09d65e5d603bccd26dca4d86c52.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXVoprXUMAIX7XE.jpg)**

Want to know more about reinforcement learning? She recommends [@EmmaBrunskill](https://twitter.com/EmmaBrunskill)’s’ online lecture series from [@StanfordEng](https://twitter.com/StanfordEng). Watch them here:

For a more practical and hands-on introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning, Feryal points to “Spinning up in Deep RL” from [@OpenAI](https://twitter.com/OpenAI). Try it here: [bit.ly/2KfQbvw](https://bit.ly/2KfQbvw)  [#AtHomeWithAI](https://threadreaderapp.com/hashtag/AtHomeWithAI)**

For those looking for lectures, slides and Colabs on various [#DeepLearning](https://threadreaderapp.com/hashtag/DeepLearning) techniques, [@FeryalMP](https://twitter.com/FeryalMP) highlights [@Khipu_AI](https://twitter.com/Khipu_AI) as a favourite. She suggests working through the collection of practical notebooks here:
