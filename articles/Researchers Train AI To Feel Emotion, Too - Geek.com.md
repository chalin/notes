Great news for the coming robot apocalypse: Our AI overlords will be able to understand and communicate human emotions.

Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder [built a neural network](https://cc.zdtc.app/v1/otc/05YcxvrJv7bM0tkN3uaIbHd?veneer=dynamic&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.colorado.edu%2Ftoday%2F2019%2F07%2F25%2Fcomputer-system-knows-how-you-feel) to accurately classify images into 11 emotion categories.

“Machine learning technology is getting really good at recognizing the content of images—[at] deciphering what kind of object it is,” Tor Wager, senior author of the study, said in a statement.

“We wanted to ask: Could it do the same with emotions?” he continued. “The answer is yes.”

Building on existing neural network AlexNet, which enables computers to recognize objects, team lead Philip Kragel retooled the tech to predict how a person would feel when they see certain photos.

He then fed the new network, dubbed EmoNet, 25,000 images—from erotic pictures to nature scenes—and asked it to sort them into 20 categories, like craving, sexual desire, horror, awe, and surprise.

EmoNet accurately (and consistently) identified 11 of the emotion types—some more easily than others.

For instance, it recognized photos that evoke craving or sexual desire with more than 95 percent accuracy, but struggled with nuanced emotions like confusion.

Even a flat color elicited predictions: When EmoNet saw a black screen, it registered anxiety; red conjured craving.

Once initial testing proved successful, researchers invited 18 human subjects to participate alongside the neural network.

Hooked up to a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine to measure their brain activity, people were shown four-second flashes of 112 images.

EmoNet saw the same pictures.
Activity in the human brains matched that of the neural network.

“We found a correspondence between patterns of brain activity in the occipital lobe and units in EmoNet that code for specific emotions,” Kragel explained. “This means that EmoNet learned to represent emotions in a way that is biologically plausible, even though we did not explicitly train it to do so.”

The research also shed new light on how and where images are represented in the human brain, suggesting that even a brief, basic image can have an impact on our emotions.

“This shows that emotions are not just add-ons that happen later in different areas of the brain,” according to Wager, now a professor at Dartmouth College. “Our brains are recognizing them, categorizing them, and responding to them very early on.”

“What you see and what your surroundings are can make a big difference in your emotional life,” Kragel added.

Ultimately, a system like EmoNet could help people digitally screen out negative images or find positive ones; it could also be applied to improve human-computer interactions.
