The Cockroaches North America  | I once thought that I was a musician. That all ended when I found this channel. I am terribly critical of all musicians and though I tried to spot some sort of break in the rythym or a sour harmony or even a mispronounced lyric.I found nothing but shear devotion towards the song. You guys have that "lost in space" kind of look when you are into a song. It's a look you don't see very often and by only a few artists. All I can say is that I AM A HUGE FAN !!!!!!

melomaniac  | I'm trying to decide if I should use this incredible cover as inspiration to become better at guitar myself, or if I should use it as a sign to quit whilst I'm ahead

henry link  | I have been following Josh Turner for over a year now and I never fail to be in awe of his talent. I'm 75 and have been playing banjo for 25 years. I feel like a beginner next to him - and not even talking mandolin, guitar, bass uke and lute!
