We first got to know [Humza Deas](https://www.instagram.com/humzadeas/?hl=en) three years ago, when he was a 17-year-old [self-taught](http://www.wnyc.org/story/sideshow-podcast-17-humza-deas-puts-shame-your-instagram-game/) photographer taking the sorts of thrilling pictures of the city, often from places he wasn’t technically supposed to be, which someone who is maybe no longer a teenager would probably not attempt. One of them ended up on [the cover](https://www.instagram.com/p/wpLStaEqEL/) of our 2014 Reasons to Love New York issue, of his legs dangling awesomely (or terrifyingly, if you’ve got a touch of vertigo) over the streets. More recently, he’s been experimenting with taking photos with a drone, letting us again see our familiar city in all-new ways. We loved them, and asked him to shoot some of them just for us.

All of Manhattan / NYC is not a no fly zone:

https://faa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=9c2e4406710048e19806ebf6a06754ad

However you would still need approval and notify ATC.

It does appear some rules / laws could have been broken : Operating over people, Operating without line of sight, Operating after sunset and possibly others. Each of which can be negated via approved waiver.
