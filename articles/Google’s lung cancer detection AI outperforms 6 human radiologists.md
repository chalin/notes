Google AI researchers working with Northwestern Medicine created an AI model capable of detecting lung cancer from screening tests better than human radiologists with an average of eight years experience.

When analyzing a single CT scan, the model detected cancer 5% more often on average than a group of six human experts and was 11% more likely to reduce false positives. Humans and AI achieved similar results when radiologists were able to view prior CT scans.

When it came to predicting the risk of cancer two years after a screening, the model was able to find cancer 9.5% more often compared to estimated radiologist performance laid out in the National Lung Screening Test (NLST) study.

Detailed in research published today in *Nature Medicine,* the end-to-end deep learning model was used to predict whether a patient has lung cancer, generating a patient lung cancer malignancy risk score and identifying the location of the malignant tissue in the lungs.

The model will be made available through the Google Cloud Healthcare API as Google continues trials and additional tests with partner organizations.

“The AI system uses 3D volumetric deep learning to analyze the full anatomy on chest CT scans, as well as patches based on object detection techniques that identify regions with malignant lesions,” Google technical lead Shravya Shetty and product manager Daniel Tse said in a blog post today.

The model was trained using more than 42,000 chest CT screening images taken from nearly 15,000 patients, 578 of whom developed cancer within a year, during a low-dose computed tomography LDCT study the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducted in 2002.

Results were then validated with data sets from Northwestern Medicine.

Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of death on Earth, according to [World Health Organization data](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer), taking more than 2 million lives annually and killing roughly as many people each year as breast cancer.

A 2015 analysis found that only 2-4% of patients get an LDCT screening today.

“By showing that deep learning can increase specificity without sacrificing sensitivity, we hope to spur more research and conversation around the role AI can play in tipping the cost-benefit scale for cancer screening,” the blog post reads.

This is by no means Google’s first foray into cancer detection and treatment. Google Inception v3 was [used to detect lung cancer by New York University researchers last year.](https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/17/nyu-trains-open-source-google-ai-system-to-diagnose-lung-cancer/)

# IBM researchers analyze the makeup of breast cancer cells with AI

Female breast cancer is one of the most common and deadly cancer types worldwide, along with lung and colorectal cancer. It’s estimated that about 1 in 8 U.S. women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of their lifetime, and according to the World Health Organization, there were 18.1 million new cases and 9.6 million deaths worldwide last year alone.

Early detection significantly improves outcomes, and fortunately, efforts are underway at [Google](https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/21/nyu-open-sources-breast-cancer-screening-model-trained-on-over-200000-mammography-exams/), [MIT](https://venturebeat.com/2019/05/07/mit-csails-ai-can-predict-the-onset-of-breast-cancer-5-years-in-advance/), and [NYU](https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/21/nyu-open-sources-breast-cancer-screening-model-trained-on-over-200000-mammography-exams/) to improve the accuracy of breast cancer screenings with artificial intelligence. They’re not the only ones — in a paper and accompanying [blog post](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/05/breast-cancer-machine-learning/) today, scientists at IBM’s Zurich office detailed a partnership with the University of Zurich to develop a system that can identify and classify tumor and immune cells as well as their relationships.

Their work is featured in the journal *Cell.*

“While researchers have been working hard to develop novel therapeutic approaches to fight against breast cancer, the main reasons for cancer-associated deaths are still therapy resistance, relapse, and metastasis,” IBM computational systems biology researcher Marianna Rapsomaniki wrote in the blog post. “The goal is for this work to lay the foundation for future precision medicine approaches that could potentially help patients win the fight against breast cancer.”

Toward that end, Rapsomaniki and team hypothesized that breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease — i.e., that it comprises tumor cells with characteristics determined by genetic makeup, and environmental influences that communicate and interact with surrounding non-cancer cell types such as immune cells, stromal cells, and vascular cells. Furthermore, they theorized that patterns within these ecosystems might be linked to disease progression and therapy response.

To prove out their idea, the team took non-tumor samples from 144 patients and used mass cytometry — a variation of flow cytometry — to measure more than 70 proteins in over 26 million cancer and immune cells. Next, they used an AI-driven technique to identify various populations of tumor and immune cells and create a detailed atlas of breast cancer ecosystems, which they then used to define the heterogeneity of individual tumors and quantify their abnormality in comparison to matched non-tumor tissue.

Lastly, the researchers analyzed tumor-associated macrophage and T cell populations (which they note can exhibit both tumor-suppressing and tumor-supporting functions), and they associated their findings with clinical information including disease grade or tumor aggressiveness.

In the end, the team found that highly aggressive tumors are often dominated by a single tumor cell phenotype and that each tumor is unique in its cellular composition, with the more aggressive tumors differing most from the rest. Additionally, they found similarities in the tumor-associated immune system among more aggressive tumors.

They believe the work lays the foundation for the design of precision medicine treatments and suggests that immunotherapy might be a viable approach for certain groups of breast cancer patients.

“This could be a reason why a one-size-fits-all approach to cancer treatment is not always effective,” said Rapsomaniki. “Based on our findings, we believe that a specific group of breast cancer patients could benefit from immunotherapy as well. Moving forward, we will investigate the possibilities of immunotherapy in additional studies, potentially leading to a clinical study.”
