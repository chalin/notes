RFI: Advanced Education Research & Development Programs Request for Information for Advanced Education Research & Development Programs Issued by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative OVERVIEW The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) are jointly exploring whether transformative education solutions can be developed through an accelerated research and development (R&D) effort. This approach would bring together interdisciplinary teams from education research, human development research, learning measurement, evidence-based technology-enhanced practice, professional development, neuroscience, and other fields. The teams would produce models, practices, tools and other resources that are designed to achieve specific, measurable improvements in student outcomes (both academic and non-academic) across a large range of education contexts.
