Shiny Server

# Put Shiny Web Apps Online

RStudio lets you put shiny web applications and interactive documents online in the way that works best for you.

For Shiny applications, consider Shiny Server or Shiny Server Pro, which adds enterprise grade scaling, security, and admin features to the basic open source edition.

If you prefer for us to host your Shiny applications, one of our shinyapps.io plans is sure to work for you.

When you’re ready, RStudio Connect is a new publishing platform for all the work your teams create in R. Share Shiny applications, R Markdown reports, dashboards, plots, APIs, and more in one convenient place. Use push-button publishing from the RStudio IDE, scheduled execution of reports, and flexible security policies to bring the power of data science to your entire enterprise.
