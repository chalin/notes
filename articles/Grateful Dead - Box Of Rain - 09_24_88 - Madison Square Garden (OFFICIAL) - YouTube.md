LGK3482  | of course Phil isn't the best singer...but the words were written for him by Robert Hunter because Phil's dad was passing away from cancer. You can tell by Phil's facial expressions at times that he even knows he is butchering it! haha...but, It is really beautiful if you think of the words as coming from a man who's father is dying.

Patrick Jordan  | Great song ruined by Phil's horrible singing. I'm a long time Deadhead(since '78), been to many shows and love these guys. Phil is a great songwriter and a great musician.......but after '74 he had no business singing anything.
