# The Raw Videos That Have Sparked

Outrage Over Police Treatment of Blacks

  By MERCY BENZAQUEN,   [DAMIEN CAVE](http://www.nytimes.com/by/damien-cave) and   [ROCHELLE OLIVER](http://www.nytimes.com/by/rochelle-oliver)    UPDATED DEC. 14, 2017

 From footage showing the death of Eric Garner in 2014 to a recent clip that captured an [11-year-old girl being handcuffed](http://woodtv.com/2017/12/12/grpd-chief-to-address-girl-held-at-gunpoint-cuffed-by-officers/), raw video has thoroughly [shaken American policing](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/us/video-of-fatal-shooting-of-walter-scott-reignites-debate-on-police-use-of-force.html). Grainy images of questionable police behavior, [spread through social media](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/magazine/our-demand-is-simple-stop-killing-us.html), have led to [nationwide protests](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/16/us/protesting-police-shootings-of-blacks.html), federal investigations and changes in policy and attitudes on race.

“A lot of white people are truly shocked by what these videos depict; I know very few African-Americans who are surprised,” said Paul D. Butler, a law professor at Georgetown University and a former prosecutor. “The videos are smoking-gun evidence,” he added, “both literally because they are very graphic, which generates outrage, and figuratively, because people believe their own eyes.”

These videos include graphic scenes of violence.  [Related Article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/25/us/charlotte-scott-shooting-video.html)

 ** Correction: July 15, 2016 **

An illustration on Saturday about two years of violent encounters between police and minority Americans misstated the location of one such episode. The shooting of Samuel Debose took place near the University of Cincinnati, not on the campus. (The officer involved, however, worked for the university.)
