## About this course

 [Skip Course Description](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-part-1-mitx-6-041-1x?source=aw&awc=6798_1525007956_c1f56b49a04db02647c7f1c1c5e8bb9f&utm_source=aw&utm_medium=affiliate_partner&utm_content=text-link&utm_term=301045_https%3A%2F%2Fwww.class-central.com%2F#what-you-will-learn)

The world is full of uncertainty: accidents, storms, unruly financial markets, and noisy communications. The world is also full of data. Probabilistic modeling and the related field of statistical inference are the keys to analyzing data and making scientifically sound predictions.

This is Part 1 of a 2-part sequence on the basic tools of probabilistic modeling. Part 1 introduces the general framework of probability models, multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, conditional distributions, and various powerful tools of general applicability. Part 2 will then continue into further topics that include laws of large numbers, the main tools of Bayesian inference methods, and an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains).

The contents of the two parts of the course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class, which has been offered and continuously refined over more than 50 years. It is a challenging class, but will enable you to apply the tools of probability theory to real-world applications or your research.

Probabilistic models use the language of mathematics. But instead of relying on the traditional "theorem - proof" format, we develop the material in an intuitive -- but still rigorous and mathematically precise -- manner. Furthermore, while the applications are multiple and evident, we emphasize the basic concepts and methodologies that are universally applicable.

## **FAQ**

**Can I still register after the start date?**

You can register at any time, but you will not get credit for any assignments that are past due.

**How long does this course last?**

The course starts on Tuesday, September 5, 2017 and ends on the due date of the final exam, on Friday, December 22, 2017.

**What is the format of the class?**

The course material is organized along units that are aligned with the chapters of the textbook. Each unit contains between one and three lecture sequences. Each lecture sequence consists of short video clips, interleaved with short problems to test your understanding. Each unit also contains a wealth of supplementary material, including videos that go through the solution of various problems.

**What textbook do I need for the course?**

None - there is no required textbook. The class follows closely the text Introduction to Probability, 2nd edition, by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, Athena Scientific, 2008; see the publisher's website or Amazon.com for more information. However, while this textbook is recommended, the materials provided by this course are self-contained.

**Do I need to watch the lectures live?**

Video lectures, as well as worked problems, will be available and you can watch these at your own convenience. Homework assignments and exams, however, will have due dates.

**Will the text of the video clips be available?**

Yes, we provide transcripts of all clips (lectures, worked problems, etc.) that are synched to the videos.

**How are grades assigned?**

Grades (Pass or Not Pass) are based on a combination of scores on lecture exercises, six problem sets, a midterm exam, and a final exam.

**How much do I need to work for this class?**

This is an ambitious class in that it covers a lot of material in substantial depth. Furthermore, the only way of mastering the subject is by actually solving on your own a fair number of problems. MIT students who take the corresponding residential class over the course of a single semester, typically report an average of about 12 hours total spent each week, including lectures, recitations, readings, homework, and exams.

This online class is a slowed-down version of the residential class, spread over two semesters. You should expect about 6 hours of work per week, on the average. The workload of different weeks is not necessarily uniform, there will be plenty of time between the release of materials and the due dates of assignments so that individual participants can adjust their own pace and schedule.
