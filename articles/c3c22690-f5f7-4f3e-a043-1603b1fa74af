**There are more than 7,000 languages or dialects regularly spoken around the world. Take a look at which ones are most popular in 2020.**

The new [infographic released by Word Tips](https://word.tips/100-most-spoken-languages/) takes a detailed – and unique – look at currently spoken languages. The visual is based on a list by [The Ethnologue](https://www.ethnologue.com/guides/ethnologue200) that for 15 years has been analyzing languages used by 88% of the world’s population.

What’s most interesting about this visual is that it groups languages by origin, helping analyze how different groups are doing.

Therefore, instead of a simple list that ranks languages, you will see them broken into a few groups, such as Indo-European (the largest one, including English, Hindi, or Spanish), Sino-Tibetan (Chinese), Afro-Asiatic (with Standard Arabic and Egyptian on the top).

The number that’s shown left to the language name is the position in the Top 100. Here are the Top 5 languages in the world in 2020, based on the number of total speakers:

1.  **English –** 1,132,366,680 speakers
2.  **Mandarin Chinese** – 1,116,596,640 speakers
3.  **Hindi** – 615,475,540 speakers
4.  **Spanish** – 534,335,730 speakers
5.  **French** – 279,821,930 speakers

While English has the highest total number of speakers, Mandarin Chinese has the highest number of native speakers. About 918 million people speak Mandarin, followed by over 460 million native speakers of the Spanish language.

### _The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes_

The Hunger Games Prequel

_by Suzanne Collins_

Part 1: The Mentor

Coriolanus released the fistful of cabbage into the pot of boiling water and swore that one day it would never pass his lips again. But this was not that day. He needed to eat a large bowl of the anemic stuff, and drink every drop of broth, to prevent his stomach from growling during the reaping ceremony. It was one of a long list of precautions he took to mask the fact that his family, despite residing in the penthouse of the Capitol’s most opulent apartment building, was as poor as district scum. That at eighteen, the heir to the once-great house of Snow had nothing to live on but his wits.

His shirt for the reaping was worrying him. He had an acceptable pair of dark dress pants bought on the black market last year, but the shirt was what people looked at. Fortunately, the Academy provided the uniforms it required for daily use. For today’s ceremony, however, students were instructed to be dressed fashionably but with the solemnity the occasion dictated. Tigris had said to trust her, and he did. Only his cousin’s cleverness with a needle had saved him so far. Still, he couldn’t expect miracles.

The shirt they’d dug from the back of the wardrobe—his father’s, from better days—was stained and yellowed with age, half the buttons missing, a cigarette burn on one cuff. Too damaged to sell in even the worst of times, and this was to be his reaping shirt? This morning he had gone to her room at daybreak, only to find both his cousin and the shirt missing. Not a good sign. Had Tigris given up on the old thing and braved the black market in some last-ditch effort to find him proper clothing? And what on earth would she possess worth trading for it? Only one thing—herself—and the house of Snow had not yet fallen that far. Or was it falling now as he salted the cabbage?
