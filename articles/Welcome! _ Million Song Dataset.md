Welcome! | Million Song Dataset

# Welcome!

The **Million Song Dataset** is a freely-available collection of audio features and metadata for a million contemporary popular music tracks.

Its purposes are:

- To encourage research on algorithms that scale to commercial sizes
- To provide a reference dataset for evaluating research
- As a shortcut alternative to creating a large dataset with APIs (e.g. The Echo Nest's)
- To help new researchers get started in the MIR field

The core of the dataset is the feature analysis and metadata for one million songs, provided by [The Echo Nest](http://the.echonest.com/). The dataset does not include any audio, only the derived features. Note, however, that sample audio can be fetched from services like [7digital](http://www.7digital.com/), using [code](https://github.com/tb2332/MSongsDB/tree/master/Tasks_Demos/Preview7digital) we provide.

The Million Song Dataset is also a cluster of complementary datasets contributed by the community:

- [SecondHandSongs dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/secondhand) -> cover songs
- [musiXmatch dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/musixmatch) -> lyrics
- [Last.fm dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/lastfm) -> song-level tags and similarity
- [Taste Profile subset](http://millionsongdataset.com/tasteprofile) -> user data
- [thisismyjam-to-MSD mapping](http://millionsongdataset.com/thisismyjam) -> more user data
- [tagtraum genre annotations](http://www.tagtraum.com/msd_genre_datasets.html) -> genre labels
- [Top MAGD dataset](http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/mir/msd/) -> more genre labels

The Million Song Dataset started as a collaborative project between [The Echo Nest](http://the.echonest.com/) and [LabROSA](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/). It was supported in part by the NSF.

### How to get started

To get a sense of the dataset, you can look at this [description](http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/example-track-description) of one of the million songs.

To start your own experiments, you can [download](http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/getting-dataset) the entire dataset (280 GB). We also provide a [subset](http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/getting-dataset#subset) of 10,000 songs (1%, 1.8 GB compressed) for a quick taste.

While waiting for the download, take a look at the [FAQ](http://millionsongdataset.com/faq), which includes a list of all the fields in the database.

We also have a set of suggested [tasks](http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/code), including snippets of code to get you started.

Please [contact us](http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/contact-us) if you have any questions about the dataset and how to use it. You can also try browsing and posting on our [forum](http://millionsongdataset.com/forum/1) (registration required).
