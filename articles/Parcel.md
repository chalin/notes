Parcel

###  Blazing fast bundle times

Parcel uses worker processes to enable multicore compilation, and has a filesystem cache for fast rebuilds even after a restart.

###  Bundle all your assets

Parcel has out of the box support for JS, CSS, HTML, file assets, and more - no plugins needed.

###  Automatic transforms

Code is automatically transformed using Babel, PostCSS, and PostHTML when needed - even `node_modules`.

### ✂️ Zero config code splitting

Using the dynamic `import()` syntax, Parcel splits your output bundles so you only load what is needed on initial load.

###  Hot module replacement

Parcel automatically updates modules in the browser as you make changes during development, no configuration needed.

###  Friendly error logging

Parcel prints syntax highlighted code frames when it encounters errors to help you pinpoint the problem.
