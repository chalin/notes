Over the last two years, the Natural Language Processing community has witnessed an acceleration in progress on a wide range of different tasks and applications. **This progress was enabled by a shift of paradigm** in the way we classically build an NLP system: for a long time, we used pre-trained word embeddings such as *word2vec* or *GloVe* to initialize the first layer of a neural network, followed by a task-specific architecture that is trained in a supervised way using a single dataset.

Recently, several works demonstrated that we can learn hierarchical contextualized representations on **web-scale datasets **leveraging **unsupervised (or self-supervised) signals such as language modeling **and transfer this pre-training to downstream tasks (*Transfer Learning*).**  **Excitingly, this shift led to significant advances on a wide range of downstream applications ranging from *Question Answering*, to *Natural Language Inference* through *Syntactic Parsing…*

A few weeks ago, a friend of mine decided to dive in into NLP. He already has a background in Machine Learning and Deep Learning so he genuinely asked me: **“Which papers can I read to catch up with the latest trends in modern NLP?”**. ‍‍

That’s a really good question, especially when you factor in that NLP conferences (and ML conferences in general) receive an exponentially growing number of submissions: **+80%** NAACL 2019 VS 2018, **+90%** ACL 2019 VS 2018, …

I compiled this **list of papers and resources **for him, and I thought it would be great to share it with the community since I believe it can be useful for a lot of people.
