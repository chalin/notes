#  Roll out at your own pace

Ablator is a Service that enables you to **roll out functionalities in a controlled way**, and perform **good A/B testing**.

#### Controlled Rollout

 **You have 40.000 users.** Do you want all of them to hit your server at once after that new update? If not, consider carefully and systematically releasing your new functionality with ablator.

#### A/B Testing

 **Your new app design could go two, three, many tasty ways.** Want to distribute each variant among your users and see how they are doing? ablator keeps track which user gets which flavor.

It works like this:

1. You define your app's switchable functionalities in ablator.

2. Your app asks ablator **"User X wants Functionality Y. Which Flavor should they get, if any?"**

3. ablator takes care of rolling out the feature in a way that you define.

As an administrator, you'll get a nice overview of what percentage of users has a functionality enabled. ðŸ˜Ž

## Try It Out BETA

For free even!

 **Ablator is in an extended Beta period where the service is fully usable, but the UI is a bit rough around the edges.** To iron everything out, and to let you [fearlessly try it without any commitment](http://ablator.space/), you can use the hosted version of ablator completely free of charge.

The software will always be open-source, and you will always be able to self-host it for free.

If you choose to use hosted ablator in the beta period, and want to switch to self-hosted at a later point, we'll do our best to help you migrate your data.

#### Come to Space!

The hosted version of ablator is at [ablator.space](http://ablator.space/)! You should try it out and then tell us how you like it! Your feedback is awesome!

 [Register at ablator.space BETA](http://ablator.space/)

 It's free and quite stable, but please be advised that we take no responsibilty for lost data at this point.
