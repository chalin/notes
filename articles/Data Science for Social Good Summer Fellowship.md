**The Data Science for Social Good Fellowship** is a [University of Chicago](http://dsapp.uchicago.edu/) summer program to train aspiring data scientists to work on data mining, machine learning, big data, and data science projects with social impact. Working closely with governments and nonprofits, fellows take on **real-world problems** in education, health, energy, public safety, transportation, economic development, international development, and more.

For **three months** they learn, hone, and apply their data science, analytical, and coding skills, collaborate in a fast-paced atmosphere, and learn from mentors coming from industry and academia.

In 2019, we are expanding globally and running two programs in the UK: one in collaboration with Alan Turing Institute and University of Warwick, and the other other with Imperial College London. The 2019 programs are bringing **40** aspiring data scientists from across the world to London and Warwick. They are current (or recent) graduate and undergraduate students from quantitative and computational fields – from computer science and machine learning, to statistics, math, physical sciences and engineering, to social sciences, public health and public policy.

From June until ends of August, they are working in teams of 3-4 on data science projects in partnership with nonprofits and government agencies, to tackle data-intensive high impact problems in education, public health, public safety, transportation, criminal justice, environmental issues, city operations, and social services, learning from full-time experienced mentors and project managers.
