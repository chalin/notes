**My fiancée and I are looking to buy our first home together. We live in London and are both first-time buyers. I am a British national and my fiancée is American. Once we are married, we will both apply for dual nationality. In the future, we are likely to spend some time living abroad (including in the US). Please may you advise us on the financial and residency/citizenship implications if we buy and sell property in the UK (or the US)? Will home ownership impact either of our applications for citizenship to each other’s nationality? **

**Philip Barth, head of immigration for Europe and Asia at law firm Withers**, says the most important thing is for you both to decide where you want to live, and not rush to get your green card unless you plan to live in the US first. As your fiancée will tell you, one catch of being a [US citizen is the long arm of the US tax authority](https://www.ft.com/content/155936ec-2728-11e6-8ba3-cdd781d02d89), which extends around the world.

As you no doubt know, marriage will not automatically confer your citizenship on each other — you will both need to become eligible and apply for your partner’s citizenship. So it is important that you do this in the right order so you can avoid being caught out by unwelcome tax obligations.

Typically, couples purchase a home as joint owners, and that is probably what you intend to do. In the UK, private residence relief is available when you sell your home which, assuming you meet the requirements, means there will be no UK capital gains tax to pay. However, US taxpayers are subject to US capital gains tax on the gain from the sale of their principal residence over $250,000 (or over $500,000 if you are filing jointly).

If you own the property jointly, your fiancée will need to report 50 per cent of the gain. With UK house prices rising so fast, $250,000 as a contribution to a property from your finances [may not buy you very much](https://www.ft.com/content/6bc32272-abdf-11e6-ba7d-76378e4fef24). What you can do instead is hold the property as tenants in common so that specific percentages of the home ownership are attributed to both of you, say 60 per cent to you and 40 per cent to your fiancée. You will need to be careful that the percentage ownership reflects your actual contributions to the property purchase, otherwise there could be gift tax issues as well. You may also want to discuss a pre-nup agreement, so that you both feel comfortable with this allocation of ownership.

Thinking of your fiancée’s path to British citizenship, she will need to spend five years under a spouse visa before becoming eligible for indefinite leave to remain; only then will she be eligible for citizenship. Home ownership in the UK will be considered a positive factor for all of these applications.

All of this planning goes out of the window if you decide to purchase property in the US or you obtain a green card. The sale of a US property will be subject to US capital gains tax, regardless of where you are living at the time (although the same principal residence exclusion may apply if you qualify).

As a green card holder you will be subject to US income tax on your worldwide income and assets. Also keep in mind that within six months of being issued with a preliminary US immigrant visa as fiancé of a US citizen, which is the first step in securing a green card, you must enter the US.

**George Bull, senior tax partner at RSM**, adds that UK inheritance tax will also be a significant consideration for international couples. Broadly, a person’s UK assets will be within the scope of inheritance tax subject perhaps to the residential nil-rate band for a person’s home. This is restricted in respect of property values over £2m. Overseas assets will generally be within the scope of inheritance tax if the person is domiciled, or deemed to be domiciled, in the UK.

If a couple are of different domicile, then it is important to be aware that assets cannot be transferred without limit from the UK-domiciled individual to the non-domiciled individual. The current lifetime nil-rate band for these transfers is £325,000. After marriage, it’s possible for the non-domiciled recipient to elect to be treated as UK domiciled for tax purposes. This may get around the problem of the limited exemption, but may have other implications.

### Our next question

One of my brothers has just died and his estate of about £100,000 will be split between me and my two remaining brothers. There is no will so I am applying for letters of administration. Another of my brothers is an alcoholic who has spent the money he had when his house was sold due to divorce and also the inheritance from our parents. He has been living in rented accommodation with no real possessions. He is currently in prison and will probably be there for a couple of years at least. Is there any way my other brother and I can tie up his money so that he does not go on an almighty binge on his release and waste all this money? We thought we could buy him a flat (nowhere near London) so he at least has somewhere to live. Are there any legal issues we need to be aware of?
