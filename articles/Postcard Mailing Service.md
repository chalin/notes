Postcard Mailing Service

## About

This began as a Mother's Day gift. My mother loves my photos, but hates using computers, smartphones, etc. I created this service to quickly send physical copies of my photos, and then built out the service a little more to also send to nieces and nephews. Today, I regularly send postcards to my family and close friends.

#### Why not Instagram?

As mentioned, my original audience (my mother) avoids technology. I have nieces, nephews and young cousins who are also too young to use online photo sharing services. But they*love*getting mail! Since launching the service, I've realized that basically everyone loves getting something in the mail that's not a bill or junk mail—even more so when it's a pretty picture!

#### Why's it free?

It's not entirely free—you get five free postcards. But to answer the question, at this point this is very much a side project and not a side hustle. I've shared it with a close circle of friends and think there's potential for this to become a product, but it's not quite there yet. So while I'm working on product/market fit, no legal entities and no credit card merchant accounts.

#### How do I get more credits?

Send me an email! I can be reached at[adam@der.wiki](https://postcardmailer.herokuapp.com/mailto:adam@der.wiki)and would love to hear more about your use case in exchange for some more credits.
