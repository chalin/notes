### ![](../_resources/6c037fb1a55c7de3663c7efae3070f8e.png)A Layered Approach to Data Visualization

deck.gl allows complex visualizations to be constructed by composing existing layers, and makes it easy to package and share new visualizations as reusable layers. We already offer a [catalog of proven layers](https://deck.gl/#/documentation/layer-catalog) and we have many more in the works.

### ![](../_resources/2e4c33c5414b325d1451af290ff6c3a7.png)High-Precision Computations in the GPU

By emulating 64 bit floating point computations in the GPU, deck.gl renders datasets with unparalleled accuracy and performance.

### ![](../_resources/7f2a4eef9dc109458f1fad7bd13fcddf.png)React and Mapbox GL Integrations

deck.gl is a great match with React, supporting efficient WebGL rendering under the Reactive programming paradigm. And when used with Mapbox GL it automatically coordinates with the Mapbox camera system to provide compelling 2D and 3D visualizations on top of your Mapbox based maps.
