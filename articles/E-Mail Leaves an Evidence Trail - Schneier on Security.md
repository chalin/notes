E-Mail Leaves an Evidence Trail - Schneier on Security

# E-Mail Leaves an Evidence Trail

If you're going to commit an illegal act, it's best [not to discuss it in e-mail](https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/paul-manafort-couldnt-convert-pdfs-to-word-documents.html). It's also best to Google tech instructions rather than asking someone else to do it:

> One new detail from the indictment, however, points to just *> how*>  unsophisticated Manafort seems to have been. Here's the relevant passage from the indictment. I've bolded the most important bits:

> Manafort and Gates made numerous false and fraudulent representations to secure the loans. For example, Manafort provided the bank with doctored [profit and loss statements] for [Davis Manafort Inc.] for both 2015 and 2016, overstating its income by millions of dollars. The doctored 2015 DMI P&L submitted to Lender D was the same false statement previously submitted to Lender C, which overstated DMI's income by more than $4 million. The doctored 2016 DMI P&L was inflated by Manafort by more than $3.5 million. To create the false 2016 P&L, on or about October 21, 2016, **> Manafort emailed Gates a .pdf version**>  of the real 2016 DMI P&L, which showed a loss of more than $600,000. **> Gates converted that .pdf into a "Word" document so that it could be edited**> , which Gates sent back to Manafort. **> Manafort altered that "Word" document**>  by adding more than $3.5 million in income. He then **> sent this falsified P&L to Gates and asked that the "Word" document be converted back to a .pdf, which Gates did and returned to Manafort**> . Manafort then sent the falsified 2016 DMI P&L .pdf to Lender D.

So here's the essence of what went wrong for Manafort and Gates, according to Mueller's investigation: Manafort allegedly wanted to falsify his company's income, but he couldn't figure out how to edit the PDF. He therefore had Gates turn it into a Microsoft Word document for him, which led the two to bounce the documents back-and-forth over email. As attorney and blogger Susan Simpson [notes on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheViewFromLL2/status/966807752696909826), Manafort's inability to complete a basic task on his own seems to have effectively "created an incriminating paper trail."

If there's a lesson here, it's that the Internet constantly generates data about what people are doing on it, and that data is all potential evidence. The FBI is 100% wrong that they're [going dark](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4325815-Director-Wray-Testimony.html#document/p5/a392750); it's really the [golden age of surveillance](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/07-08-15%20Swire%20Testimony.pdf), and the [FBI's panic](https://cyber.harvard.edu/pubrelease/dont-panic/) is really just its own [lack of technical sophistication](https://www.wired.com/2013/01/wiretap-backdoors/).
