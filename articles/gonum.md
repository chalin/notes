Gonum is a set of packages designed to make writing numeric and scientific algorithms productive, performant, and scalable.

Gonum contains libraries for [matrices and linear algebra](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/mat);[statistics](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/stat),[probability](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/stat/distuv)[distributions](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/stat/distmv), and [sampling](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/stat/sampleuv); tools for[function differentiation](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/diff/fd),[integration](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/integrate/quad), and [optimization](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/optimize);[network](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph) creation and analysis; and more.

We encourage you to [get started](http://gonum.org/post/introtogonum/) with Go and Gonum if

- You are tired of sluggish performance, and fighting C and vectorization.
- You are struggling with managing programs as they grow larger.
- You struggle to re-use – even the code you tried to make reusable.
- You would like easy access to parallel computing.
- You want code to be fully transparent, and want the ability to read the source code you use.
- You’d like a compiler to catch mistakes early, but hate fighting linker and unintelligible compile errors.
