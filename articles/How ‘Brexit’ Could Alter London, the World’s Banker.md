# How ‘Brexit’ Could Alter London, the World’s Banker

By [KARL RUSSELL](https://www.nytimes.com/by/karl-russell)MAY 11, 2017

 For centuries, London has functioned as a critical artery for the flow of money around the world. From Canary Wharf to the City of London, it now comprises one of the greatest concentrations of financial companies on earth. But a large piece of London’s banking business depends on its inclusion in the European Union. Britain is now moving to exit the union, jeopardizing its status as a leading global financial center.

## Britain is a global financial hub

Nearly one-fifth of the world’s banking transactions go through the United Kingdom, with most moving through London.

## And it has more international flair

While New York is largely centered on the American markets, London is more focused on the world, catering to a global clientele that runs from French money managers to Saudi princes to Chinese billionaires.

## Banking helps drive London’s economy

Much of London’s business is connected to Europe, in deals that could be effectively be illegal after Brexit.

 Notes: *Switzerland is not part of the European Union but follows many of the E.U.’s banking rules. †Crown dependencies of Britain. Luxembourg and Cyprus are omitted from the chart showing banking as a share of G.D.P., because their relatively small economies make their share incomparable. | Sources: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; Bank for International Settlements

## Brexit will put jobs at risk

At the high end of estimates, as many as 80,000 finance positions could depart over the next two years.
