Deep Reinforcement Learning Course

#  A free course in Deep Reinforcement Learning

Deep Reinforcement Learning Course is a free series of blog posts about Deep Reinforcement Learning, ** where we'll learn the main algorithms, and how to implement them in Tensorflow.**

The goal of these articles is to explain step by step from the big picture and the mathematical details behind it, to the implementation with Tensorflow

Some of the environments you will work with during this course:
