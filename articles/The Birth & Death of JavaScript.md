The Birth & Death of JavaScript

# The Birth & Death of JavaScript

A talk by Gary Bernhardt from PyCon 2014

This science fiction / comedy / absurdist / completely serious talk traces the history of JavaScript, and programming in general, from 1995 until 2035. It's not pro- or anti-JavaScript; the language's flaws are discussed frankly, but its ultimate impact on the industry is tremendously positive. For Gary's more serious (and less futuristic) thoughts on programming, try some [Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts) screencasts.
