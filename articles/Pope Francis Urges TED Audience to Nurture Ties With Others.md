[Pope Francis](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/f/francis_i/index.html?inline=nyt-per) urged an audience of technophiles and entrepreneurs on Tuesday to use their powers of curiosity and inquiry to explore and nurture the relationships that bond human beings to one another.

“How wonderful would it be if the growth of scientific and technological innovation would come along with more equality and social inclusion,” Francis said in a recorded video talk that was shown at the TED conference in Vancouver, British Columbia. “How wonderful would it be, while we discover faraway planets, to rediscover the needs of the brothers and sisters orbiting around us.”

Francis has had a complicated relationship with technology. He has embraced social media much more than his predecessors, but he also warned in a 2016 [encyclical](https://laudatosi.com/watch) that the omnipresence of digital communications “can stop people from learning how to live wisely, to think deeply and to love generously.”

The pope urged wealthy and powerful people to show solidarity with the poor and powerless, particularly migrants.

“I, myself, was born in a family of migrants,” Francis said. “My father, my grandparents, like many other Italians, left for Argentina and met the fate of those who are left with nothing. I could have very well ended up among today’s discarded people. And that’s why I always ask myself, deep in my heart, ‘Why them and not me?’”

Why the only future worth building includes everyone | Pope Francis  Video by TED

TED — which stands for technology, entertainment and design — is a media company that streams and broadcasts lectures by notable people and organizes conferences built around those lectures. The talks have become a kind of secular sermon, and they are often delivered, cited and quoted by prominent Silicon Valley figures and those who follow their activities. Other speakers who are addressing this week’s conference include Serena Williams and the entrepreneur Elon Musk.

The pope’s 18-minute talk, which was recorded at the [Vatican](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/r/roman_catholic_church/index.html?inline=nyt-org), was similar in style to those of other TED speakers. He addressed the conference in Italian, speaking from behind a desk, using plain language and personal anecdotes. The talk can be viewed [on TED’s](https://www.ted.com/talks/pope_francis_why_the_only_future_worth_building_includes_everyone?language=en)[website](https://www.ted.com/talks/pope_francis_why_the_only_future_worth_building_includes_everyone?language=en), where by midday Wednesday it had already been watched more than 300,000 times.

Francis’ message of hope came with an admonition.

“Please allow me to say it loud and clear: The more powerful you are, the more your actions will have an impact on people, the more you are called to be humble,” he said. “If you don’t, your power will ruin you, and you will ruin others.”

Francis is the first pope to address the conference, and booking him was not easy.

“It took many discussions to make the talk happen — and several trips to Rome over more than a year,” Bruno Giussani, TED’s international curator, wrote in a blog post. “When I first approached the Vatican, it’s fair to say that not many there knew of TED. So there was a lot of explaining to do.”
