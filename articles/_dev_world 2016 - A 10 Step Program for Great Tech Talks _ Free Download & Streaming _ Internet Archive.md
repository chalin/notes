## Abstract

You know the code and the project. Youâ€™re doing lots of cool stuff. You have plenty of slides. So why is the audience all doing their email?

It doesnâ€™t have to be that way! Great presenters are made, not born. The way to become a better speaker is through training, science, and practice. In this tutorial, veteran conference presenter VM (Vicky) Brasseur will teach you the ten steps to great tech talks:

- Know Your Audience

- Have an Idea

- Tell a Story

- Craft Your Presentation

- Practice Your Talk

- Get Ready to Speak

- Present Yourself

- Deal with Demo Failure

- Interact with the Audience

- Continue the Conversation

If you have never attended a speaker training before, this workshop will show you how much better your talks could be. If you have, you might pick up a few tis and ideas. And if youâ€™re presenting at /dev/world, this tutorial will give you some last-minute changes to tweak your talk.
