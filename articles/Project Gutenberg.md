### Problems with Blocking Access

March 5 2018: There are some problems with the automated software used to prevent abuse of the Web site (mainly to prevent mass downloads from hurting site performance for everyone else). Some fixes were applied Monday, but this did not solve all the problems our readers are encountering. It appears that downloads of epub and mobi (Kindle) formatted eBooks is triggering blocks, and the HTML ("Read this book online") links seem to work better. Apologies for ongoing difficulty, which is being addressed this week.

### Project Gutenberg Supports Net Neutrality

The Federal Communications Commission made a ruling to abandon major components of network neutrality. This legalizes "slow lanes" for network traffic that does not come from commercial partners of network providers. Sites where content is free, and generates no revenue - such as Project Gutenberg - are at risk for downgraded speeds, access fees imposed by network providers, or ads embedded by network providers. We encourage Project Gutenberg readers to [contact their US lawmaker](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials) to express views on this important issue.

### The Public Domain will grow again in 2019

In the US, annual copyright term expiry is set to begin again in 2019, after a 20-year hiatus due to the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998. On January 1, 2019, items published in 1923 will enter the public domain in the US. In the early days of Project Gutenberg, growth of the public domain on January 1 was an annual event. See Duke Law's "[Public Domain Day](https://law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday)"for a listing of many items that were scheduled to enter the public domain, but have yet to do so because of the 1998 extension. Some notable items scheduled to enter the public domain in 2019 include Felix Salten's "Bambi" and Kahlil Gibran's "The Prophet."
