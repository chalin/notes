>  Humans modify facial expressions in order to mislead observers regarding their true emotional states. Being able to recognize the authenticity of emotional displays is notoriously difficult for human observers. Evidence in experimental psychology shows that discriminative facial responses are short and subtle. This suggests that such behavior would be easier to distinguish when captured in high resolution at an increased frame rate. We are proposing SASE-FE, the first dataset of genuine and deceptive facial expressions of emotions for automatic recognition. We show that overall the problem of recognizing deceptive facial expressions can be successfully addressed by learning spatio-temporal representations of the data. For this purpose, we propose a method that aggregates features along fiducial trajectories in a deeply learnt feature space. Interesting additional results show that on average it is easier to distinguish among genuine expressions than deceptive ones and that certain emotion pairs are more difficult to distinguish than others.
