**For those who love books, but don’t have enough time for reading. Here are the best books you can read in under an hour each.**

In today’s world people have less and less time for reading. That’s why we observe the growing popularity of short reads: novellas, short stories, or flash fiction.

Short reads promise you’ll dive into a new world, and experience the same emotions, as when reading a novel – but in a shorter time.

The revival of short books is possible thanks to digital publishing. Unlike in print, a 20-page short story can be easily published as an ebook. Its price is less than a cup of coffee.

There is a growing number of projects that focus on publishing and promoting short-form reading. A great example: [Kindle Singles](http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sv_kstore_5?ie=UTF8&node=2486013011&tag=eflyus-20). Curated by Amazon, it’s a collection of quality reads between 5,000 and 30,000 words. You can find here books by previously unpublished authors, but also from big names, such as Stephen King, Jodi Picoult, or Chuck Palahniuk.

On average, an adult person reads 300 words per minute, or 18k words per hour. The average paperback has about 250 words per page. This means an average reader should be able to finish in less than an hour any book that is up to 70 pages long.

To compare, the average novel is between 80k and 100k words. You’ll need five to six hours to finish it. For some people this becomes an excuse: “I don’t have time for reading books.”

In our new infographic, you’ll find 24 best short reads. Each book comes with the info about the estimated reading time, based on the number of pages.

In theory, you should be able to read all these books in just one day.

I don’t mean to force you to break the world record in speed reading. I don’t mean to persuade you to fill almost a half of 52-books-per-year challenge in one day.

Just imagine a plenty of worlds you can travel, characters you can meet, and emotions you can feel, if you decide to pick up a few good short reads.

*Philip K. Dick*

*Chuck Palahniuk*

Rachel married Ted because he was uncomplicated and loyal. But he was also devoted to his wretched house and his first love, an old, flatulent cat named Belinda Carlisle.

Once Rachel becomes pregnant, Ted reluctantly agrees to move and give up the cat. But the house doesn’t sell.

*Stephen King*

In a pulls-no-punches essay intended to provoke rational discussion, Stephen King sets down his thoughts about gun violence in America.

Anger and grief in the wake of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School are palpable in this urgent piece of writing, but no less remarkable are King’s keen thoughtfulness and composure as he explores the contours of the gun-control issue and constructs his argument for what can and should be done.

“I think the issue of an America awash in guns is one every citizen has to think about,” said King. “If this helps provoke constructive debate, I’ve done my job.”

Estimated reading time: **21 minutes**. Number of pages: 25.

*James Grady*

Award-winning short story author and novelist James Grady delivers a bullet-paced, savage journey with the iconic character he created and that Robert Redford made an international sensation in the movie “Three Days of the Condor.”

Love, sex, loyalty, honor and savagery loosed in our modern world electrify this novella, a portrait of heroism and horror and America beyond 9/11. It is an espionage adventure unlike anything you’ve ever read.

This short story is an explosive teaser of the upcoming novel *Last Days of the Condor*.

Estimated reading time: **38 minutes**. Number of pages: 46.

A short story written by Franz Kafka in 1917. Contained within the story is a parable that was separately published as “A Message from the Emperor.”

Estimated reading time: **22 minutes**. Number of pages: 27.

When a powerful storm approaches the Tower, the four men — and everyone on board — must face their increasingly probable deaths.

*Edgar Allan Poe*

Roderick Usher’s fate is inextricably intertwined with that of his sister, Madeline, and that of their estate. As one falls, so do they all.

A pioneer of the short story genre, Poe’s stories typically captured themes of the macabre and included elements of the mysterious.

*Nick Hornby*

In this short story Nick Hornby paints a wincingly comic picture of just how messy modern relationships can become, as his characters hit delightful new lows of cruelty, misery, and pettiness.

*Robert Louis Stevenson*

An intriguing combination of fantasy thriller and moral allegory, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, depicts the gripping struggle of two opposing personalities — one essentially good, the other evil — for the soul of one man.

Its tingling suspense and intelligent and sensitive portrayal of man’s dual nature reveals Stevenson as a writer of great skill and originality, whose power to terrify and move us remains, over a century later, undiminished.
