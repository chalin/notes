About The Music Genome Project® The Music Genome Project powers Pandora. It's the most comprehensive analysis of music ever undertaken. For over a decade, we've been gathering musical knowledge to bring you the best, most personalized listening experience out there. We believe each individual has a unique relationship with music – no one has tastes that are exactly the same. So delivering a great experience to every listener requires a broad and deep understanding of music. Our team of trained musicologists has been listening to music across all genres and decades, including emerging artists and new releases, studying and collecting musical details on every track– 450 musical attributes altogether.
