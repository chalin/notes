"We get fresh produce. It’s like it’s off the farm because the quality of the food is so good and so fresh!"

Donna, Resident, Housing for Women

"There is great camaraderie in the team and whether I'm out in the van as a co-driver or helping in the warehouse, I finish my shift with a smile on my face."

Barbara Gougoulis, Volunteer

"I volunteer as a co-driver at least twice a week and feel so privileged and so happy to work with the best team of people from many different backgrounds, nationalities and professions. This is a most fulfilling and heart-warming new chapter in my life."

John McNally, Volunteer

"The charities all rely on us, and I know this personally as I work for one of the charities we deliver to. I cook the food on Tuesday that Felix deliver on a Monday. The job needs doing and I’m very happy to be a part of Felix."

Gretchen Fisher, Volunteer

"When I saw the ad in the Evening Standard late last summer I immediately knew this was the kind of volunteering I wanted to get involved in. The wonderful food we pick up is far too precious to be thrown away, and so it makes sense to distribute to different charities. So rewarding - can’t get better than that!"

Thérèse Diffey, Volunteer

"As I retired recently I started helping out on the Felix Project in West London. A worthy cause that came from a sad event. I love the work and the people are fun and I enjoy spending a morning or afternoon giving something back to the community."

Sean Birch, Volunteer

"I am a retired person with too much spare time on my hands and this volunteering opportunity gives me something useful to do, as well as the chance to meet new people."

Ken Goodman, Volunteer

"There is so much food wasted every day when there are people all around us who are hungry. Collecting surplus food donated by supermarkets and delivering it direct to other charities, who then use this food to make meals, is such a simple but brilliant idea."

Tony Stokes, Volunteer

"Finishing a shift at the Felix Project, it really feels as if you’ve done something worthwhile, as if you’ve made a contribution - and it makes you feel good about yourself."

John, Volunteer

"You know that food is going to come on a certain day, and you don’t have to worry so much"

Amy, Resident , Housing for Women

"We've donated to the Felix Project for some time now and find them really easy to work with. You'd barely know the arrangement was in place once you've got into a routine."

Tim Richards, Deputy Branch Manager, Waitrose

"Volunteering has enabled me to obtain a good understanding of what happens to unwanted food from wholesalers and retailers in an urban environment. I would like to think that the support that I have given, big or small, has benefited someone somewhere."

Winston Gordon, Volunteer

"We’re a company that works with every seasonable product that’s available in this country, and The Felix Project come every morning to collect our food surplus"

Charlie Mash, Founder, Mash

"We love the Felix Project. Without the fresh produce, it would limit the service we could offer our guests quite significantly."

Kizzy Anderson, Refuge Support Worker, Housing for Women

"Nutritional foods have always been very important for people with HIV. Now having the Felix Project means we can have a wide variety and range of meals every day."

Raj Sutra, Support & Development Worker, The River House Trust
