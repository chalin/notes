Description

For my entire lesson site check out: www.the-art-of-guitar.com

You're over there dreaming about Liz Phair when suddenly your singer yells, "Take a solo!!!" You forget what key you're in and suddenly you collapse on the stage, eyes rolled back, green foam oozing from your mouth. Don't let this happen to you! WATCH THIS VIDEO.

I think Rivers Cuomo of Weezer has been using your method through about 8 albums.

I have played by ear since I picked up the guitar, so I've always used this technique to find the key; I also use the third string. I learned fret positions (5th fret is A, third G, etc.) instead of keys, so I still ask people, "what fret", when it's anything other than E, G, A. . . and sometimes why?

You're always one step away from a decent note. Paul Shaffer said the same thing, I think.
