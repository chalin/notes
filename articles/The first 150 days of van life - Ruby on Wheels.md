# The first 150 days of van life

 *October 8, 2017*

Today marks my 150th day in my van. Since I [left](https://ruby-on-wheels.github.io/blog/leaving-berlin/) Berlin in May I visited 6 countries, drove more than 12,000 km, collected more than 180,000 Wh of solar power and met a lot of interesting people.

The van life definitely left its marks on me.

## Getting inspired by ideas instead of following a plan

As a remote software engineer, I can work when I feel productive and rest when my brain is tired. Still my life was very structured around my flexible working hours. Usually I had a detailed plan for the upcoming week: lunch with my ex-co-workers on Monday, a birthday dinner on Tuesday, cinema on Wednesday, giving a talk on Thursday, going to a concert on Friday, going for a bike ride on Saturday and so on.

I rarely spent time relaxing in my hammock or in the park around the corner to enjoy the sun and let my thoughts flow. Even though my job was amazing I regularly felt the need for a break: vacation or just working from another place for a couple of weeks.

Since I’ve lived in my van I’ve never felt the need for a vacation or a change. Instead of following a fixed plan, I get inspired by random ideas: When the waves are great, I go surfing. When it’s chill and fresh, I work. When it’s hot, I go for a swim. When I’m tired, I sleep. When I like a place, I stay. When I meet someone cool, I join them for a while. When my van breaks, I try to get it fixed.

My life in the van feels like a smooth flow of uncontrolled events. Things just happen without too much planning. And sometimes I just do nothing but relaxing in my hammock.

## Living more healthy

Berlin offers a great variety of delicious and affordable places to eat. Why should I have spent my valuable time on grocery shopping and cooking, if I could get a great meal right around the corner? Although it’s very easy to eat out in a big city, it’s more challenging to stick to a healthy diet. I often ate stuff like shawarma, burgers, doner kebab, schnitzel or pizza.

Since I moved in my van I’ve cooked a lot. Usually my meals consist of a variety of vegetables and **a lot** of olive oil. Sometimes I refine them with meat or fish. Cooking doesn’t feel like an effort anymore. I’m not in a hurry because I have to be somewhere in 20 minutes. I take my time and enjoy it. Win-win: I relax my mind while preparing a healthy meal.

I park my van in open and green areas whenever possible. The windows are usually open. I can smell the fresh air all day long.

Sometimes I even work outside of my van on a camping table.

I work in a natural environment instead of a smelly office with a fake climate produced by an A/C. When I turn my head, I see trees, the mountains, the sea or a river. It takes me one second to leave my desk and walk barefoot in the gras, sand or water. No need for a bike or train ride for several minutes though a crowed city full of fumes.

In Berlin I regularly had a slight cold. Roughly every third month, I would feel a little sick or exhausted. Since I’ve lived in the van I haven’t been sick **once** in five months.

## Living more sustainable

When you live in an average apartment in Berlin it feels like resources are unlimited. Whenever you open the tap, there’s endless fresh water. Whenever you plug a device into an outlet, you can run it as long as you want. Drying your hair with a 2000 watts blow dryer after taking a hot shower for 20 minutes at night: no problem!

That changes when you live in a van. All of a sudden everything is limited and you start using things more sustainably. When my water tank is empty, I have to go and find a source of water and carry the water back to my van. When it’s dark, I have 200 Ah in my battery until the sun will charge it the next day. The amount of water that I used in Berlin to brush my teeth is probably enough for a whole day in my van. Maybe 80% of the water just flowed from the tap right into the drain without even touching my body.

The limitations of a van don’t necessarily result in a lower quality of life. I can still do everything I want. I just don’t waste that much resources any more, because I am more aware of their limitations. We often forget about these. Especially when we live in western urban areas.

## Being more outgoing

In Berlin, I usually didn’t approach the next random stranger on the street and started a conversation. Instead, I made plans with my friends and mostly ignored all the unknown people around me. Even if I would pay attention to these strangers, they mostly seemed busy or tired from work.

When I leave my van after work and go to the beach, I usually meet relaxed and open-minded people: vacationers, travelers, surfers, hippies. They don’t seem to be stressed and everyone has interesting stories to tell. No stranger is surprised if I approach them out of the blue and say “hi”. It’s normal. I definitely get more in touch with new people than I did before my trip.

## A simpler, happier life?

My life has gotten way simpler within the last 150 days. I feel more flexible because I don’t plan that much any more. If I don’t get something done today, I don’t worry and will continue tomorrow. As a Spanish traveler once told me,

>
> The sun rises every day.
I feel very balanced and am looking forward to all the things ahead of me!
