The art of pen spinning or pen twirling can take a while to master. It took me about 3 months initially to learn the thumbaround. I had seen someone spinning their pen during class. I thought it was the coolest thing ever! So I started trying to figure out pen spinning on my own. The first pen trick I ended up learning was the thumb-around. I pretty much did everything wrong at first. I had a very short pencil with one of those fat erases on the end of it... so the balance was just awful. Back then, I didn't understand which types of pens/pencils can make pen spinning easier or harder to learn.
