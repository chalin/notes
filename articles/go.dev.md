## Why choose Go

- ![](../_resources/af5cb5a277513ab820445e2c63548803.png)

### Easy to learn

“At the time, no single team member knew Go, but **within a month, everyone was writing in Go** and we were building out the endpoints. It was the flexibility, how easy it was to use, and the really cool concept behind Go (how Go handles native concurrency, garbage collection, and of course safety+speed.) that helped engage us during the build. Also, who can beat that cute mascot!”

- [Jaime Enrique Garcia Lopez, Senior Software Development Manager at CapitalOne](https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/a-serverless-and-go-journey-credit-offers-api-74ef1f9fde7f)

### Efficient

 **"A small language that compiles fast makes for a happy developer.** The Go language is small, compiles really fast, and as a result it lets your mind focus on the actual problem and less on the tool you are using to solve it. Code, test, debug cycles are so quick that you forget you are not working with an interpreted language. Looking at our code, you see **less boilerplate and more business logic**."

- [Clayton Coleman, lead engineer, Open Shift at RedHat](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/birthday-bash-2014/openshift-3-old-dogs-new-tricks/)

### Powerful

“**Go has excellent characteristics for scalability and services written using it typically have very small memory footprints**. Because code is compiled into a single static binary, services can also be containerised with ease, making it much simpler to build and deploy. These attributes make **Go an ideal choice for companies building microservices**, as you can easily deploy into a highly available and scalable environment such as Kubernetes.”

## Learn Go

“I started writing in Go when I was just out of college and couldn’t believe how quickly I picked it up, especially compared to other languages. I had spent months learning about how to build APIs in other languages (and mostly failing), but **after a week of writing Go, I had completed my first API**.”
