Reinforcement learning (RL) practitioners have produced a number of excellent tutorials. Most, however, describe RL in terms of mathematical equations and abstract diagrams. We like to think of the field from a different perspective. RL itself is inspired by how animals learn, so why not translate the underlying RL machinery back into the natural phenomena they’re designed to mimic? Humans learn best through stories.

This is a story about the Actor Advantage Critic (A2C) model. Actor-Critic models are a popular form of Policy Gradient model, which is itself a vanilla RL algorithm. If you understand the A2C, you understand deep RL.

After you’ve gained an intuition for the A2C, check out:

- •Our [simple code implementation](https://github.com/rgilman33/simple-A2C/blob/master/3_A2C-nstep-TUTORIAL.ipynb) of the A2C (for learning) or our industrial-strength [PyTorch version](https://github.com/rgilman33/baselines-A2C) based on [OpenAI’s TensorFlow Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines) model
- •[Barto & Sutton’s Introduction to RL](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~straka/courses/npfl114/2016/sutton-bookdraft2016sep.pdf), [David Silver’s canonical course](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html), [Yuxi Li’s overview](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07274) and [Denny Britz’ GitHub repo](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning) for a deep dive in RL
- •[fast.ai’s awesome course](http://www.fast.ai/) for intuitive and practical coverage of deep learning in general, implemented in PyTorch
