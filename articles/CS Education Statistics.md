CS Education Statistics

# CS Education Statistics

#### Computer Science in US Secondary Schools

Computer science courses in K-12 education are fading from the national landscape at the very moment they are needed most. Introductory secondary school computer science courses have decreased in number by 17 percent from 2005. The number of Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Courses has similarly decreased by 33 percent.

Despite its critical and growing importance, computer science is taught in only a small minority of U.S. schools. There currently are just over 42,000 high schools in the United States. But only 2,100 of them were certified to teach the AP computer science course in 2011, and in fact only 21,139 students took the AP exam.

#### STEM Coursetaking Trends

The percentage of U.S. high school students taking STEM courses has increased over the last 20 years across all STEM disciplines except computer science where it dropped from 25% to 19%

### AP Computer Science Exam Statistics

Nationally, computer science is the only STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) field that has seen a decrease in student participation in the last 20 years ([Time](http://techland.time.com/2012/07/16/can-we-fix-computer-science-education-in-america/%20)). In California, less than 1 percent of all advanced placement exams taken in 2011 were in computer science. Moreover, student access to these courses is unequal and unrepresentative of the state’s demographics.

According to [College Board](http://www.collegeboard.org/), which tracks AP exams, 3,101 students took the AP computer science exam in 2011. By comparison, about 35,000 students took AP government, 55,000 took U.S. history, and 58,500 students took English language. Of those who did take the computer science exam, 29 students were African American and only 21 percent were girls.

The U.S. Department of Labor estimates that by 2020 there will be more than 1.4 million computing-related job openings. At current rates, however, we can only fill about 30% of those jobs with U.S. computing bachelor’s grads. Girls represent a valuable, mostly untapped talent pool.
