## 1 in 4 developers started coding before they could drive

It’s never too early — or too late! — to start coding. Of the roughly 39,000 developers surveyed across all professional levels, more than a quarter of developers wrote their first piece of code before they were 16 years old.

Meanwhile, of all the developers who started coding after the age of 26, 36% are now senior or even higher-level developers, growing quickly in their careers.

### When did you start coding?

#### Learning & Education

## The PC revolution sparked a unique ambition among ‘70s kids

Unlike generations thereafter, if kids of the seventies wanted to see innovative technology, they’d have to build it themselves — they had no other choice. There were no widespread resources to teach them how to build software. Almost half of all developers (47%) between the ages of 45 and 54 started coding before they were 16 years old. Meanwhile, developers between 18 and 24 today are the least likely to have started coding before 16 (only 20%).

Developers between the ages of 45 and 54 were among the first to get their hands on relatively powerful PCs, like the Acorn Archimedes, TRS-80, Commodore 64, and Apple II. With limited to no access to formal education, young people in the PC Revolution had an unusually strong drive to learn to code on their own.

## Hats off to the UK for leading the pack for youngest coders

Of the 17 countries represented in the survey with at least 100 respondents, the UK stands out with the highest share of developers who started coding as young as 5 to 10 years old. The majority of those developers are in their 30s and 40s today.

When these developers were schoolyard kids, the Acorn Archimedes, a Cambridge-based PC, hit the scene. Thanks to a partnership with Tesco in which schools received these PCs in exchange for shopping at Tesco, more kids had access to computers. This initiative spread across Europe and Australia.

Today, this culture of forward-thinking education has persisted in the UK — it became the first nation to modernize its curriculum by requiring kids as young as 5 to take programming classes.

Policymakers repeatedly cite that early exposure to coding is an important step in creating a gateway to careers in software and understanding the principles of computational thinking and software that influences daily life.

## Nearly all developers have an insatiable thirst for learning

It seems like every year there’s a new hallmark programming language, framework or library that proliferates across developer blogs. First, it was all about Backbone.js. Now, everyone is raving about AngularJS and React. Self-teaching is the norm for developers of all ages. Even though 67% of developers have CS degrees, roughly 74% said they were at least partially self-taught.

On average, developers know 4 languages, and they want to learn 4 more. The degree of thirst for learning varies by generations — young developers between 18 and 24 plan to learn 6 languages, whereas folks older than 35 only plan to learn 3.

Since programming is centered on independent research aimed at solving new challenges, self-teaching is a major part of being a successful developer. In choosing what to learn next, the best guiding principle is to plant yourself in one discipline and learn tools as a means to grow. Tools will always change. Ultimately, it’s curiosity and genuine interest in programs that should fuel the drive to learn new tools and adapt to tech’s evolving landscape.

### How did you learn to code?

## And new generations are opting for YouTube to self-teach over books

Stack Overflow is the number one tool for self-learners — surprise :). This is true across age groups. Developers value step-by-step advice from peers who came, saw, and conquered challenges before them.

There is, however, a clear age group divide between YouTube and books as the second favorite resource for learning to code. The very nature of learning is changing; younger generations are flocking to YouTube while older generations prefer books to learn new skills. More specifically, when learning a new tool, Millennials log onto YouTube (65%), while Gen Xers pick up a book (85%).

Both have unique advantages. YouTube enables a systematic teaching paradigm, which allows for structured, steady progress that mimics university curriculums… except you can do it at your own pace. Another benefit is adaptability. While YouTube can ride the ebbs and flow of software’s agile advancements, textbooks are timeless relics of CS fundamentals. Anyone can produce a new YouTube tutorial in less than a day, though it won’t offer textbooks’ years of carefully thought out lessons. Either way, one thing is clear: We are on the cusp of an evolution in coding education.
