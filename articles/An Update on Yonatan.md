I’ll be leaving the company at the end of this month, and wanted a chance to wish all of you the best before I do.<br>Over the past years, I have had the great fortune to have many of you as my teachers. It’s hard for me to enumerate all of the things I have learned from you. But as I head out, I'd like to share back the distillation of some of the most valuable things that I've gotten from you, in the hope that this compact form may be useful to some of you as well.<br>**1. First, know where you want to go; then, figure out how you’re going to get there.**<br>It’s often tempting to look at where you are and think about what incremental improvements could bring value most quickly. This is a fast way to get stuck at local maxima. Instead, make a habit of routinely surveying the problem space as a whole – especially by talking to your customers – and figure out what a perfect world would look like. Then work backwards from there to figure out what it will take to get there. The resulting milestones can (and should!) also deliver intermediate value, but they’ll likely be different from the ones you would have picked if you didn’t know where your goal was.<br>Always keep a mental image of your ultimate goal in mind.<br>(NB this is also one of the themes of go/pomkra)<br>**2. When you make an important decision, write down concisely what you’ve decided and why.**<br>A pattern in the worst mistakes I’ve seen teams make has been that the crucial decisions happened “by accident” – everyone thought the other people were OK with it, so they figured it was fine. But when it comes down to a critical decision, you’ll need to routinely re-examine it later, and you’ll very likely be asked by other people to justify it. In almost all cases, you’ll need to make later decisions on its basis. There is a simple tool to avoid bullshitting yourself: write down what you’ve decided, and a simple explanation of why. Make it short enough that you can explain it from memory.<br>If multiple people are involved in the decision, this is even more important: make sure that  *everyone agrees with what has been written down.*  Multiple people “agreeing” to different specific things, or with different intuitions in mind, turns out not to look as much like agreement as you think.<br>Those of you who have been around long enough to remember Real Names or the Blogger Porn Policy Incident should consider those as excellent illustrations of what happens when you  *don’t*  do this – in both of those cases, all the people who thought they were agreeing actually weren’t, and when chaos ensued, the resulting responses were muddled at the worst possible time.<br>**3. Pay close attention to what people actually want.**<br>Your users, your customers, your partners, your manager, your teams – there are lots of stakeholders you need to get on board with most decisions you make. The way to get people on board is to be able to tell a coherent, unifying story, and ensure that people are  *actually*  bought in to it. The way to ensure this is to make sure that the story satisfies the things they actually care about, whether or not they’re consciously aware of it. So spend effort in figuring this out. When you talk to them, watch which subjects they get excited about. Ask them about the things that annoy them the most; if you can fix those, they will be disproportionately happy. Sometimes those fixes are even really small things.<br>**4. Deliver value in both the short term and the long term.**<br>When you first enter a new problem space, make sure to identify some people’s urgent frustrations, and relieve them as quickly as possible. This will not only make them happy, it will start to build up your social capital with them, which will give you the runway and air cover you need to develop long-term solutions to problems.<br>As you are developing the long-term solutions, make certain that your intermediate milestones deliver real value as well, and make sure you can not only articulate that value, but that you have excited customers for each milestone. This serves two purposes: First, it yields happy customers; and second, it means that even if the broader project ends up failing, you will not have wasted your time.<br>With any long-term investment, find yourself a flagship customer or two. These are customers who are big enough to think on the time scales required for you to provide the results, and who have the resources to work with you to tune things until they work. The difference between a flagship customer and an ordinary one is that launching your flagship customer is your primary goal: you consider your product to work when that customer is satisfied. You will work with them so closely that most people won’t even know who’s on which team. Having a big customer who cares about your product succeeding will both give you a tremendous amount of practical support, and ensure that you’re building something which solves a real problem.<br>**5. Any fool can build a system; any amateur can make it perform. Professionals build systems that fail well.**<br>It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking about how a system should work and what features it should have. If you want to go from the amateur leagues to the professional leagues, think about the ways in which your system can fail, and design it for that. This should involve every aspect of the system, especially integrated ones: what happens if a network link goes down? What happens if a config file push is bad? What happens if a user misunderstands a UI element? What happens if a malicious user tries to use it to harm other users?<br>The heart of good engineering is building a system which will fail well. There are some universal principles: make your system monitorable (so that you can see both what it  *is doing*  and what it is  *trying to do*) and controllable; make it fail safe, so that in case of an emergency it can get itself into a state that’s doing the least harm possible while it asks for help; use defense in depth, so that many things have to fail before the system as a whole fails; make it easily understandable, so that if your pagers go off at 3 in the morning and the bug is in an unfamiliar subsystem, you can figure it out and bring it under control; make it easy to do the normal thing, and hard but possible to do dangerous things.<br>But there are also many specific principles, ranging from understanding the ways short- and long-haul networks can be unreliable to the patterns of interpersonal abuse people experience on-line. Spend time with people who are experienced in each of these matters; become best friends with SRE, with Security, with Privacy, with Abuse, with Legal, with NetOps, with everyone who works on the disciplines of how things fail. Read the SRE book, commit its lessons to memory, and think about how you can generalize them to everything you work on, including people.<br>The sign of an experienced engineer, PM, PgM, or UXer is that people can use their systems, even under tremendously stressful situations, and bad things will not happen.<br>There are obviously far more things than this short list, but I hope that these items prove useful to at least some of you.<br>For those of you who want to keep in touch, my non-work address is [zunger@gmail.com](mailto:zunger@gmail.com), and I’ll still be filling the Internet with my ramblings on (prod) G+, Twitter, and Medium:<br>[google.com/+YonatanZunger](http://google.com/+YonatanZunger)<br>[twitter.com/@yonatanzunger](http://twitter.com/@yonatanzunger)<br>[medium.com/@yonatanzunger](http://medium.com/@yonatanzunger)<br>Thank you all for some amazing years!<br>![](../_resources/325472601571f31e1bf00674c368d335.gif) |     |     |
