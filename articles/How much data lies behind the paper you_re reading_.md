Science consists of [standing on the shoulders of giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants): we run experiments, submit the results to expert peers, and publish the summaries so that others can use them as foundations for their own research. We base our careers on the validity and trust of our results.

But what happens when trust in science erodes?
