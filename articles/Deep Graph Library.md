## Highlighted Features

 

 [No Migration Cost](https://docs.dgl.ai/)

DGL is built atop of popular Deep Learning frameworks such as Pytorch and Apache MXNet.

 

 [Smooth Learning Curve](https://docs.dgl.ai/)

Learning DGL is a blink. The powerful user-defined functions are both flexible and easy to use.

 

 [High performance](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples/pytorch)

DGL automatically batches deep neural network training on one or many graphs together to achieve max efficiency.

## Feedback from community

By far the cleanest and most elegant library for graph neural networks in PyTorch. Highly recommended! Unifies Capsule Nets (GNNs on bipartite graphs) and Transformers (GCNs with attention on fully-connected graphs) in a single API.

##### Thomas Kipf

 Inventor of Graph Convolutional Network

I taught my students Deep Graph Library (DGL) in my lecture on "Graph Neural Networks" today. It is a great resource to develop GNNs with PyTorch.

##### Xavier Bresson

 Associate Professor of NTU

Brought to you by NYU, NYU-Shanghai, and Amazon AWS.
