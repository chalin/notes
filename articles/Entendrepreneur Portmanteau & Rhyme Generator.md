## Suggestions

Need some help coming up with interesting inputs? Try one of these:

- [rhino + hospital](https://www.punchlinedesign.net/pun_generator/rhino+hospital)

- [awful + Mozart](https://www.punchlinedesign.net/pun_generator/awful+Mozart)

- [NASA + jokester](https://www.punchlinedesign.net/pun_generator/NASA+jokester)

Note that the inputs are case-sensitive, so for example typing "apple" will primarliy match the fruit, but typing "Apple" will primarily match the company.

## UPDATE

I've been overwhelmed with the attention this site has received, and I've had to upgrade the servers to cope with the traffic. Unforutately that also means increased costs, and because I want to keep this site ad-free, I would greatly appreciate it if you could make a donation to help keep the site running, thank you!
