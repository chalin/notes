# Festival of the Spoken Nerd

After touring to 15,000 people across the UK in 2015, featuring on BBC2 QI, creating the first truly experimental comedy series for Radio 4 and writing their first book, the Nerds are back with a new live show, [**You Can’t Polish A Nerd**](http://festivalofthespokennerd.com/show/you-cant-polish-a-nerd/). You can also hear Series 2 of **[Domestic Science](http://festivalofthespokennerd.com/tvradioshow/domestic-science/)** from Wednesday 21st February, live at 11pm on BBC Radio 4 or on iPlayer afterwards.

Join stand-up mathematician **Matt Parker**, experiments maestro **Steve Mould** and geek songstress **Helen Arney** at a night full of electrifying live experiments, spectacular songs and mind-bending maths. More 2018 dates on sale soon, join our mailing list below to get the details first.

Shows are suitable for nerds and non-nerds aged 14+ unless otherwise stated, as they contain scenes of multiple recursion.
