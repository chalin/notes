 [ ##  Overview](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#overview)

This year, over 64,000 developers told us how they learn and level up, which tools they’re using, and what they want.

Each year since 2011, Stack Overflow has asked developers about their favorite technologies, coding habits, and work preferences, as well as how they learn, share, and level up. This year represents the largest group of respondents in our history: 64,000 developers took our annual survey in January.

As the world’s largest and most trusted community of software developers, we run this survey and share these results to improve developers’ lives: We want to empower developers by providing them with rich information about themselves, their industry, and their peers. And we want to use this information to educate employers about who developers are and what they need.

We learn something new every time we run our survey. This year is no exception:

- A common misconception about developers is that they've all been programming since childhood. In fact, we see a wide range of experience levels. Among professional developers, 11.3% got their first coding jobs within a year of first learning how to program. A further 36.9% learned to program between one and four years before beginning their careers as developers.

- Only 13.1% of developers are actively looking for a job. But 75.2% of developers are interested in hearing about new job opportunities.

- When we asked respondents what they valued most when considering a new job, 53.3% said remote options were a top priority. A majority of developers, 63.9%, reported working remotely at least one day a month, and 11.1% say they’re full-time remote or almost all the time.

- A majority of developers said they were underpaid. Developers who work in government and non-profits feel the most underpaid, while those who work in finance feel the most overpaid.

Want to dive into the results yourself? In a few weeks, we’ll make the anonymised results of the survey available for download under the [Open Database License (ODbL)](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/). We look forward to seeing what you find!

Each month, about 40 million people visit Stack Overflow to learn, share, and level up. We estimate that 16.8 million of these people are professional developers and university-level students.

Our estimate on professional developers comes from the things people [read and do](https://kevinmontrose.com/2015/01/27/providence-machine-learning-at-stack-exchange/) when they visit Stack Overflow. We collect data on user activity to help surface jobs we think you might find interesting and questions we think you can answer.

Compared to the rest of the world, the United States has a higher proportion of people who identify as full stack web developers, whereas Germany has a comparatively lower proportion. As for mobile developers, the U.S. and United Kingdom have proportionally more iOS developers and fewer Android developers than the rest of the world.

People other than full-time developers also write code as part of their jobs, and they come to Stack Overflow for help and community. This year, we gave additional occupation options to respondents who are not full-time developers, but who occasionally code as part of their work. These roles include analyst, data scientist, and educator.

A common misconception about developers is that they've all been programming since childhood. In fact, we see a wide range of experience levels. Among professional developers, one-eighth (12.5%) learned to code less than four years ago, and an additional one-eighth (13.3%) learned to code between four and six years ago. Due to the pervasiveness of online courses and coding bootcamps, adults with little to no programming experience can now more easily transition to a career as a developer.

Web and mobile developers have significantly less professional coding experience, on average, than developers in other technical disciplines such as systems administration and embedded programming. Across all developer kinds, the software industry acts as the primary incubator for new talent, but sees a relatively low proportion of more experienced developers. For example, 60% of mobile developers at software firms have fewer than five years of professional coding experience, compared to 45% of mobile developers in other industries.

Among professional developers, 11.3% got their first coding jobs within a year of first learning how to program. A further 36.9% learned to program between one and four years before beginning their careers as developers. Globally, developers in Southern Asia had the lowest average amount of prior coding experience when beginning their careers; those in continental Europe had the highest.

We asked respondents for their gender identity. Specifically, we asked them to select each of the following options that apply to them:

- Male

- Female

- Transgender

- Non-binary, genderqueer, or gender non-conforming

- A different identity (write-in option)

According to Quantcast, women account for 10% of Stack Overflow’s U.S. traffic. Similarly, 10% of survey respondents from the U.S. identify as women. In our survey last year, 6.6% of respondents from the U.S. identified as women.

Meanwhile, women account for 9% of Stack Overflow’s UK traffic, while 7.3% of survey respondents from the UK were women. Finally, women account for 8% of Stack Overflow’s traffic from both France and Germany, while 5.1% and 5.6% of respondents from those countries, respectively, identify as women.

We will publish additional analysis related to respondents’ gender identities in the coming weeks.

 ** 33,033 responses; select all that apply

This was the first year we asked respondents for their ethnic identity. We asked them to select each option that applied.

We asked respondents this question to add an important dimension to what we can learn about developers. In addition, public policy researchers and employers frequently look to us for information on how they can reach out to and better understand underrepresented groups among developers.

We will publish additional analysis related to respondents’ ethnic identities in the coming weeks.

 ** 1,755 responses identified as having a disability

Similar to our question about ethnicity, this was the first year we asked respondents for their disability status. Of the 3.4% of respondents who identified as having a disability, we asked them to select each option that applied, and we included a write-in option. We know developers can experience many forms of disability. For this survey, we confined our list of standard options on this question to disabilities that require some physical accommodation by employers.

We will publish additional analysis related to respondents’ disability status in the coming weeks.

We asked respondents, “What is the highest level of education received by either of your parents?” Similar to ethnicity and disability status, this is the first year we asked this question. We asked this question in part because public policy researchers and some employers seek information about first-generation college students to improve their efforts to support them.

We will publish additional analysis on this in the coming weeks.

#### [Developer Role and Gender](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#developer-profile-developer-role-and-gender)

[Developer Role and Gender](../_resources/ff5994ef6046b517cc4140018e32e138.bin)  ** The dashed line shows the average ratio of men's to women's participation

While the sample as a whole skewed heavily male, women were more likely to be represented in some developer roles than others. They were proportionally more represented among data scientists, mobile and web developers, quality assurance engineers, and graphic designers. The dashed line shows the average ratio for all of these developer roles.

Respondents who identified as White or of European descent were less likely to report being a mobile developer than those who identified as South Asian, Hispanic or Latino/Latina, or East Asian. A higher proportion of respondents who identified as Hispanic or Latino/Latina selected “web developer” as an option compared to those who selected White or of European descent, South Asian, or East Asian.

Important note: We didn't receive enough responses from developers of some ethnicities to include them here with reliable percentages. However, we do see that many developers who identify as Black or of African descent work as web developers and mobile developers, and many developers with Middle Eastern ethnic backgrounds work as web developers and desktop applications developers. Developers who identified as Native American, Pacific Islander, or Indigenous Australian work as web developers at a high rate.

More than half (54.2%) of professional developers who had studied at a college or university said they had concentrated their studies on computer science or software engineering, and an additional quarter (24.9%) majored in a closely-related discipline such as computer programming, computer engineering, or information technology. The remaining 20.9% said they had majored in other fields such as business, the social sciences, natural sciences, non-computer engineering, or the arts.

Among current students who responded to the survey, 48.3% said they were majoring in computer science or software engineering, and 30.5% said they were majoring in closely-related fields. Finally, 21.2% said they were focusing on other fields.

 ** 23,355 responses

Of current professional developers, 32% said their formal education was not very important or not important at all to their career success. This is not entirely surprising given that 90% of developers overall consider themselves at least somewhat self-taught: a formal degree is only one aspect of their education, and so much of their practical day-to-day work depends on their company’s individual tech stack decisions.

However, computer science majors and computer engineering majors were the most likely (49.4%) to say their formal education was important or very important.

Compared to computer science majors, respondents who majored in less theoretical computer-related disciplines (such as IT, web development, or computer programming) were more likely to say their formal educations were unimportant.

Due to the high demand for professional developers, coding bootcamps have exploded in popularity in the past few years. Although commonly perceived as a way for non-developers to transition into a new career, we found that 45.8% of those who said they’d gone through a bootcamp were already developers when they started the program. This is likely because many developers decide at various parts in their career that they need to upgrade their skills or learn new technologies to stay relevant in the job market.

Want to learn to code but don’t know where to start? More developers say you should take an online course than any other method, followed by getting a book and working through the exercises.

As an important side note, we received great feedback on how we phrased this question, specifically the option, “Get a job as a QA tester and work your way into a developer role.” Although some developers start their careers as QA testers, the phrasing made it sound as if we saw QA as just a stepping stone, rather than a vital function and career option. QA professionals are our heroes (and QA engineers are 3.5% of our respondents this year!), and we apologize for not more carefully crafting our language.

For the second year in a row, Rust was the most loved programming language. This means that proportionally, more developers wanted to continue working with it than any other language. Swift, last year's second most popular language, ranked as fourth.

For the second year in a row, Visual Basic (for 2017, Visual Basic 6, specifically) ranked as the most dreaded language. Most dreaded means that a high percentage of developers who are currently using the technology express no interest in continuing to do so.

Python shot to the most wanted language this year (as in, the language developers want to use this year more than any other), after ranking fourth last year.

 [ ##  Methodology](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#methodology)

How we ran and analyzed the survey.

This report is based on a survey of 64,227 software developers from 213 countries and territories around the world. Respondents were recruited primarily through channels "owned" by Stack Overflow, such as blog posts and banner ads on the site.

Of these, 36,601 (57% of respondents) completed the entire survey, and an additional 15,403 (24%) answered enough questions to be considered a "partial complete," for a total of 51,392 usable responses. These were distributed world-wide as follows:

| Region | Usable Responses |
| --- | --- |
| North America | 13,717 |
| UK & Ireland | 4,740 |
| France | 1,740 |
| Germany, Austria, Switzerland | 5,221 |
| Rest of Europe | 10,757 |
| Asia, Pacific, & Australia | 11,528 |
| Africa | 1,249 |
| South & Central America | 2,098 |
| Other or prefer not to say | 155 |
| **Total** | **51,392** |

The more complicated methodology stuff:

- The survey fielded from January 12th to February 6th, consistent with last year.

- The median response time for those who completed the entire survey was 26 minutes. Half of complete respondents spent between 19 and 42 minutes completing. Response time statistics are biased towards the top, because we allowed respondents to complete the survey at their leisure.

- Four-fifths of responses came from a Stack Exchange site. The remaining 20% came from social media channels through which we, partner organizations, and members of the community promoted the survey. Accordingly, visitors who came to Stack Overflow multiple times during the field period were more likely to notice the advertisements for the survey and begin to take it. Such frequent visitors include those currently seeking a job, community moderators, those who ask questions or answer them, and other highly-engaged users. Additionally, respondents who supplied a Stack Exchange profile were awarded a “Census” badge as an inducement to complete the survey.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Category | # of Respondents | % of Respondents |
| Onsite Banners | 26,547 | 52% |
| Onsite Blog | 9,912 | 19% |
| Social Facebook | 6,098 | 12% |
| Onsite Meta | 4,778 | 9%  |
| Social Misc | 258 | 1%  |
| Social Partners | 526 | 1%  |
| Social Reddit | 1,596 | 3%  |
| Social Twitter | 1,677 | 3%  |
| **Total** | **51,392** | **100%** |

- We treated respondents as usable if they completed at least the questions that ask them to describe their "developer kind." We excluded respondents who completed the entire survey in less than 10 minutes.

- Salary data were obtained by first asking respondents for their day-to-day currency, and then asking them to write in either their current or expected post-graduation salary, depending on their circumstances.

    - We converted salaries given in the 38 most-frequently-used currencies to [dollars / Euros / pounds sterling] using the exchange rate that prevailed mid-way through the survey field period.

    - The question was optional; 32% of respondents who were asked for salary data provided it.

    - Extreme outliers were trimmed from the current salary data by removing any response greater than $200,000, corresponding to the top half percent of responses.

- Many questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. The primary "triggers" for whether questions were shown include self-description as a developer (Q1), country (Q3), employment status (Q17), job-seeking status (Q41), and Stack Overflow usage (Q91). The question numbers listed here correspond to the survey instrument, which we will release along with our downloadable, anonymized results in a few weeks.

- Most of the questions in the middle of the survey (following Q36, and up until Q100) were organized into blocks. The blocks about technology usage and Stack Overflow usage were shown to all respondents. The remaining six blocks were each shown to two-thirds of respondents, with each respondent receiving four of the six blocks:

    1. Developer attitudes (Q37 to Q39)

    2. Job-seeking and compensation (Q41 to Q66)

    3. Education and professional development (Q68 to Q72)

    4. Software development practices (Q84 to Q87)

    5. Hardware and other tools (Q89 and Q90)

    6. Stack Overflow attitudes (Q97 to Q99)

Additionally, the first five blocks were shown in random order, in order to reduce any unforeseen ordering biases.

##  Stack Overflow Jobs puts developers first.

We believe that recruiting will be fixed when job sites put your needs - not their bottom lines - above all else. That’s why you’ll never receive recruiter spam or see fake job listings on our site.
