# Network Programming with Go

An e-book on building network applications using the Google Go programming language (golang). I wrote this a few years ago (2012), taking my old lecture notes about Java and network programming and rewriting them in Go. There were many things that did not copy across due to the comparative richness of the Java libraries, but where Go is applicable it generally gives cleaner and simpler code than Java.
