Opening Keynote at GopherCon 2016

Is it a constant? A variable? Where is it defined? What is its type? It has no type? It has all the types? Those are usual questions that people learning Go ask and this talk answers all of them and more.

The talk covers the different contexts where nil is used, what it means, the gotchas to be aware of, and some patterns where nil becomes essential.

In parallel to the exploration of how nil can be used I will also discuss the origin and history of nil in those contexts.
