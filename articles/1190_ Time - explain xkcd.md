## Explanation[[edit](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php?title=1190:_Time&action=edit&section=1)]

This comic is an animation, which was showing a new image every hour. In the beginning the interval was only half an hour. The unfolding story is set in the far future, at a time when the [Strait of Gibraltar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Gibraltar) has long been blocked and the [Mediterranean Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea) has largely dried up leaving smaller, hypersaline seas behind. Megan and Cueball, living on the shores of one of these seas and unaware of its natural history, notice one day while building a huge sand castle on the beach that the sea level is starting to rise. They start a journey of exploration trying to find out why. Eventually they discover that the Straits of Gibraltar have once again been breached, and that the Mediterranean Basin is being flooded. They run back to their home, assemble the people of their village, and board a makeshift raft. At the end they reach land with their rafts, searching for a new home.

On frame 2925 the title text changed from "Wait for it." to "...", and one frame later to just "RUN.". At approximately 2944, when Megan announces that it is too late to escape overland, the title text changed back to "...". On Frame 3094, the words **THE END** appear in the middle of the screen and the title text changed to "The end.". The image now links to the scrollable collection of frames at [geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/](http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/). The comic on xkcd.com today currently loops through the last five frames of the comic.

This comic now has its own [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(xkcd)) on Wikipedia.

This comic won the [2014 Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story](http://www.thehugoawards.org/2014/08/2014-hugo-award-winners/).

### Format[[edit](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php?title=1190:_Time&action=edit&section=2)]

This comic is actually a series of images which play as a rough animation. The pictures were updated over the course of time. The comic ran for 2973 hours (over 124 days) and consists of 3101 image frames.

For the first 120 hours, a new frame replaced the previous frame every 30 minutes, at :00 and :30 of each hour; the remaining frames have since been revealed every hour. The update was done server-side, with the server redirecting the image link (time.png) to a different image every hour. The source images have very long random hash names, which made it virtually impossible to access future frames. There is no way to view past frames on the official xkcd website, and only the current frame is posted there at any given time. Given the unique nature of this comic, the full image archives can be browsed through several websites that have been dedicated to tracking it (see below).

Readers typically have divided the comic into four scenes (see below). For example, at 850 hours (36 days 10 hours) the first "scene" of the comic ended at frame 971 with a fade to white, ushering in a second scene from frame 972. Some of the last few frames of scene 1 are nearly white, but faint images can be seen in the normalized pictures available below (Day 36, Monday, April 29, 2013, normalized).

There is also a wiki dedicated to this particular comic and the related forum thread, at [xkcd-time.wikia.com/](http://xkcd-time.wikia.com/). There is also a physics simulation of the trebuchet written in JavaScript/HTML5, available at [thred.github.io/xkcd-time-catapult/](http://thred.github.io/xkcd-time-catapult/). The code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/thred/xkcd-time-catapult), too. There is an Android app which notifies users when a new image is posted and lets them view the image from within the app, available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.drewhannay.xkcdtime). The code for the app is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/drewhannay/xkcd-time) and encourages contribution of new features or enhancements. An hourly updated graph of the rising water level is available at [[1]](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2169004/tide.png)

There is also [a map](http://edfel.atwebpages.com/Time-Map.php) with guesses on the locations that Megan and Cueball visit.

### Time's forum thread[[edit](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php?title=1190:_Time&action=edit&section=22)]

In the xkcd fora, this comic was given a thread like any other comic. The Time thread expanded over the months of the comic's running to include 1254 pages, or just over 50,000 posts, and continued thereafter at a considerable pace. As of August 23, 2018, it has over 106,000 posts and an enormous 38,000,000 views, which easily tops every other thread, while still being quite active. More than 1/3 of all posts within the [Individual XKCD Comic Threads subforum](http://forums.xkcd.com/viewforum.php?f=7) are in the *1190: "Time"* thread. Compared to the thread for [Click and Drag](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Click_and_Drag), it has over 50 times as many views and 150 times as many posts, while the typical comic thread has 30 to 200 posts. Its activity as a percentage of the entire fora can be seen in [this graph](http://xkcd.mscha.org/jjjdavidson/timeforumpercentage.128days.htm).

The [many frequent posters](http://xkcd.mscha.org/sciscitor/img/avatars.jpg) of the thread developed a culture surrounding Time, creating their own [mannerisms](http://xkcd-time.wikia.com/wiki/Default_footnotes), [vocabulary](http://xkcd-time.wikia.com/wiki/Glossary), and [jokes](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130610101557/xkcd-time/images/a/a5/X.png) on top of extracting every [detail](http://xkcd-time.wikia.com/wiki/Age_of_the_Slow_Pixel#Quotes) from the comic and recording every frame. More information can be found at different places on Time's dedicated wiki, or, of course, on the [thread](http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=101043)  [itself](http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=101043&start=999999999).
