### Introducing Our Berlin Neighborhood Expert, Cheryl

We created this Where to Stay in Berlin guide in collaboration with our friend, fellow Canadian, and blogger Cheryl Howard of [CherylHoward.com](http://cherylhoward.com/). Cheryl’s lived in Berlin as an expat twice now, and blogs all about the city, as well as co-hosting the wildly popular monthly Make Friends in Berlin meet-up. Since we’ve never actually lived in Berlin — only visiting for a few weeks here, and then a few weeks there — we really needed Cheryl’s expertise to get our heads around the most popular, most convenient and coolest neighbourhoods in Berlin. Luckily, Cheryl was happy to do so!

**And now…over to Cheryl!**

### Where to Stay in Berlin: Getting Your Bearings

One of the biggest dilemmas travelers face when visiting Germany’s capital is working out where to stay in Berlin, something that is compounded by the fact many people underestimate the sheer size of the city. Berlin is nine times the size of Paris, and is officially made up of 12 districts, all with their own distinct personality and flair.

The good news is, wherever you stay within Berlin, you’ll more than likely be connected a great public transport system including the U-Bahn (metro), S-Bahn (city train), tram network, and buses, with many of these services operating overnight on weekends. You’ll also find a great infrastructure of bike lanes, with many visitors opting to hire a bike which makes for a cool and easy way to see the city in style.

I’ve lived in Berlin for three years and most of my time has been spent living, working and hanging out in the city’s former east, mostly in the popular Prenzlauer Berg area. However, between meeting friends from different neighbours as well as running a popular expat meetup event (we host at a different venue each month), I’ve spent a fair amount of time exploring Berlin’s other neighbourhoods.

### When Trying to Decide Where to Stay in Berlin, Consider Hotels AND Apartments

The first thing you need to ask yourself when trying to decide where to stay in Berlin is what type of place would you like to stay in? Berlin hotels are extremely good value, size, and cleanliness when compared to other European capital cities, and are often located in close proximity to many of the city’s historical landmarks and nightlife.

For a more authentic and local experience, you might consider getting an apartment from a popular vacation rental website such as Airbnb (just bare in mind the Berlin law concerning Airbnb rentals, which can be contentious with local residents in a tense rental market – be sure to only rent a room from genuine hosts). If you’re new to Airbnb, and **[use this link](http://www.airbnb.com/c/kmatthews92),** you’ll get some credit to get you started!

Whether you choose to stay in a hotel or rent an apartment may shape your final decision about where to stay in Berlin, as some areas have more hotels, and some areas have fewer, including some of Berlin’s most popular residential neighbourhoods such as Prenzlauer Berg, Kreuzberg, Neukölln, and Friedrichshain.

Note that Berlin’s districts are quite large, and each district is comprised of small villages known as *kieze.* Some of the more popular ones include Prenzlauer Berg’s Kollwitzkiez and Helmholtzkietz, Kreuzberg’s Wranglerkiez, Neukölln’s Schillerkiez, and the area around Boxenhagener Platz and Simon-Dach Strasse in Friedrichshain.

Consider Staying Near An U-Bahn Station

Berlin’s public transport system is world-class, meaning no matter where you stay in Berlin, you’ll probably be able to get around pretty easily via the U-Bahn (pronounced “Ooooooh bahn”) underground metro, S-Bahn above-ground train, or bus and tram network.

While transit is great, we’d definitely recommend you stay on the “inside” of the S-Bahn train ring route that encircles the city. You’ll save a lot of time getting to and from the most popular tourist attractions, and you’ll find some of Berlin’s coolest neighborhoods within that ring.

Both of Berlin’s airports (Tegel and Schönefeld) are connected by either an airport bus (which goes direct to Alexanderplatz) or an S-bahn line. Be sure to buy the correct public transport ticket (AB for Tegel and ABC for Schonefeld) and validate the ticket at the start of your journey. Depending on how long you’re staying in Berlin, you may also want to buy a [Berlin WelcomeCard](https://www.wandertooth.com/i4qr), or a monthly ticket. Just carry your validated ticket with you at all times – no need to swipe on and off.

### When considering where to stay in Berlin, these are some good lines and stations to look for:

**U2**: The U2 line runs from Pankow to Ruhleben, but most importantly connects some of the most beautiful residential neighborhoods such as Prenzlauer Berg and Schöneberg, to transport and shopping hubs like Alexanderplatz, and to popular tourist attractions around Potsdamer Platz and Zoologischer Garten.

**U7**: The colourful U7 line passes through no less than 12 of Berlin’s neighbourhoods including Neukölln, Kreuzberg, Charlottenburg, and Wilmersdorf. Hermannplatz is a big and bustling station, which just a few streets away you can access cool bars, cute cafes, sprawling parks, all within a buzzing multicultural atmosphere.

**The Ringbahn**: The Ringbahn is the S-bahn ring which does a complete 37 km circuit of Berlin. All you need to remember is that the S41 goes clockwise and the S42 goes anti-clockwise. Try not to miss your stop late at night when tired, as you may end up “riding the ring” and completing several laps.

### Looking for An Easy Intro to Berlin? Stay In **Prenzlauerberg**

**Top hotel recommendations in Prenzlauerberg**: ***[Hotel Oderberger](https://www.wandertooth.com/6buv)**** **(boutique luxury), **[Adele Design Hotel](https://www.wandertooth.com/65d6)**  (affordable boutique), ****[Linnen](https://www.wandertooth.com/g82b)* ***(affordable boutique) and **[Ackselhaus & Blue Home](https://www.wandertooth.com/tusl)** (boutique luxury)*

#### Stay In Prenzlauer Berg If You’re Looking For A Bohemian-Meets-Bourgois Vibe

With its tree-lined streets, boutique shops and wine bars, bohemian-meets-bourgeois Prenzlauer Berg makes for an easygoing introduction to Berlin. Once an alternative hotspot, these days it’s much more chilled out, making it a great neighborhood for families and those who want a relaxing stay. Sundays are often best started with brunch and then it’s on to a flea market such as Mauerpark where you can also partake in some public karaoke if you’re game.

Popular *kieze* are centered around Kollwitzplatz and Helmholtzplatz, packed with cafes, bars and restaurants. My tip would be to use Google Street View before you book and check out some of the quieter streets rather than staying on the main *platz* (square). Or, rent an apartment in the ‘Hinterhof’ which is located in the back of the apartment building and then you’ll definitely get a good night’s sleep.

Prenzlauer Berg offers a cool residential local experience while being well-connected to most tourist sites, public transport, and both airports. It’s a fantastic area to stay in Berlin!

Prenzlauer Berg has a mix of modern apartments, luxury hotels, and budget accommodations…something for everyone! I’ve broken them out below, based on places I want to stay (or would recommend to a friend with confidence!).

.

.

#### Affordable Boutique

[**8.2 / 10 on Booking.com**](https://www.wandertooth.com/sqv8)

[**Adele Designhotel**](https://www.wandertooth.com/sqv8) — Boutique design that’s affordable, this place has a fun, kitschy look to it without sacrificing on comfort and a little bit of luxury. The design theme is officially art deco, but it definitely looks like they’ve added some twists and personality, as animal prints, natural materials and found objects show-up in the decor. Gets great reviews, and when I check prices on Booking.com, it looks as though rooms start at around $US 90 per night.

**[*Booking.com*](https://www.wandertooth.com/sqv8)**     /     ***[Trip Advisor](https://www.wandertooth.com/1pa7)*****

#### Affordable Boutique

[**9.2 / 10 on Booking.com**](https://www.wandertooth.com/5evk)

[**Linnen**](https://www.wandertooth.com/5evk) — Linnen has two locations in Prenzlauer Berg (and one in Mitte), and they all look drop-dead beautiful. The Sleeping Inn offers 6 rooms with an on-site café, and is the one I’d be most interested in staying in (When you click on the specific room listing on Booking.com, make sure it indicates the room connects to the café below – that’s how you know it’s the right location!). Prices start around USD $110 per night.

#### Luxury Hotel in a Character Home

[**9.3 / 10 on Booking.com**](https://www.wandertooth.com/54kk)

[**Ackselhaus & Blue Home**](https://www.wandertooth.com/54kk) — A stately character home that’s been converted into a boutique hotel (with a beautiful back garden). This place has 13 rooms, each with a distinct and totally unique theme (from Africa to New York to Beach House). To me, this place seems to strike a nice balance between a cozy, at-home feeling and boutique luxury. When I check prices on Booking.com, rooms start at around US $170 per night.

#### Lux Boutique in a Historic Landmark Building

[**8.9 / 10 on Booking.com**](https://www.wandertooth.com/ftle)

[**Hotel Oderberger**](https://www.wandertooth.com/ftle) — I want to stay here right now, and then I never want to leave. Exposed brick, floor to ceiling windows, balconies, modern design details and a beautiful restaurant. Seriously, don’t make me leave! The Oderberger gets fantastic reviews, with past guests commenting on how quiet, tranquil, and beautiful the hotel is. Plus, it’s a great story: the building used to be public baths, with the swimming pool re-opening in September 2016 for guests. Also cool, is they have rooms for more than 2 people. The apartment-style rooms fit up to 8, and aren’t that much more expensive, considering you’d be splitting it among more people. When I checked prices on Booking.com, rooms seem to start at around US$130 per night.

.

There are also loads of** beautiful, modern apartments** in Prenzlauer Berg with high ceilings, great light, and unique touches, like rooftop terraces and exposed brick walls. The problem is, these apartments sometimes book out months in advance. So if you’re planning on staying in a beautiful apartment in Prenzlauer Berg, book early! Also of note, some of these apartments seem to require a minimum nights’ stay of 2 or 3 nights. If your search is coming back “not available” for one night, try upping it to 2 or 3 nights and see if that does the trick. Berlin is too awesome for just one night anyway – stay for three nights (at least) if you can!

- For a Luxury Design Apartment, check out **[Berlin Base Apartments](https://www.wandertooth.com/1f6c).** The places (there are multiple units available) look stunningly beautiful, and get fantastic reviews. Think exposed brick wall and wide-panel wood flooring with bright white modern fixtures, and a tonne of natural daylight. Plus: rooftop terrace! There’s also a lift, which is great if you have a lot of luggage or have trouble with stairs! They are only a five-minute walk from Schönhauser Allee U-Bahn. When I [checked prices on Booking.com](https://www.wandertooth.com/1f6c) for 3 nights in May, it worked out to around USD $160 per night. **Check Availability: **[**Booking.com**](https://www.wandertooth.com/1f6c)
- For an Affordable Modern Apartment, check out [**Apartment Heinrich-Roller-Str.**](https://www.wandertooth.com/rdn8) Bright, spacious and beautiful, this apartment features lovely wooden floors, high ceilings, a nice bathroom, and a well-equipped kitchen. It’s walking distance to the M2 (Tram) Prenzlauer Allee/Metzer Str. stop, and within easy distance to Alexander Platz and Museum Island. It gets fantastic reviews on [Booking.com](https://www.wandertooth.com/rdn8) — the very best reviews in Prenzlauerberg, in fact! When I checked prices, it worked out to around USD $115 per night. BUT — fair warning — this place seems to book up really early, so plan in advance…probably a good plan with an international destination like Berlin anyway :) **Check Availability:** [**Booking.com**](https://www.wandertooth.com/mlqv)
- If you’re travelling as a family, check out [**Familienstudio 27**](https://www.wandertooth.com/o4q4) — This looks like a great option for a family of four (2 adults, 2 kids) or 4 adults (a couple and 2 friends, or two couples). The apartment consists of a double/queen bed, plus two bunk beds, meaning it can comfortably sleep 4. Again, it’s bright and modern-looking with wooden floors and high ceilings, and is on the ground floor giving easy access in a building with no lift. It’s walking distance to the Prenzlauer Allee S-Bahn station, making it convenient to get around, and again gets fantastic [reviews on Booking.com](https://www.wandertooth.com/o4q4). When I checked prices, it worked out to around USD $111 per night. Same with the last one, this family studio also seems to book up really early, so it’s best to plan your Berlin stay in advance.  **Check Availability: **[**Booking.com**](https://www.wandertooth.com/o4q4)

#### If Those Apartments Are Full, and You Really Want to Stay in An Apartment (Not a Hotel), Try These Places….

A few more apartments in Prenzlauerberg that look good, get good reviews, and seem to have fewer issues with availability:

- **[Ferienwohnung](https://www.wandertooth.com/rxsc) **– Absolutely beautiful, and it looks like you can get it for under $100 per night during some dates!
- [**Apartment Prenzlauer Berg**](https://www.wandertooth.com/6cod)— Another beautiful space, with an amazing-looking spa bath. I would be tempted to stay in the apartment all day. Plus, this place looks pretty massive!

# Looking for Some Of That Famous Berlin Cool? Check Out Kreuzberg, Friedrichshain & Neukölln

### **Kreuzberg: **Enjoy Berlin’s Reputation for Edgy, Subversive Cool

**Top hotel recommendations in Kreuzberg**: *[**Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten Berlin City**](https://www.wandertooth.com/f8fe)** **(4-Star in the Heart of East Kreuzberg) and [**Hotel Sarotti-Höfe**](https://www.wandertooth.com/et8r) (boutique cool in West Kreuzberg)*

Punk rock, LGBTQI-friendly, and politically left wing, East Kreuzberg (Kreuzberg 61) is the heart of alternative Berlin. Where squat houses, decaying buildings, street art meets third wave coffee, E. Kreuzberg is truly diverse and full of alternative and subversive cool. Kreuzberg has a long history of immigrants which is evidenced by its large Turkish population and canalside food markets (Turkish Markets at Maybachufer), as well as hipster street food at [Markthalle Neun](https://markthalleneun.de/).

Different Kreuzberg *kieze* all have their own kind of flavour but some popular kiez include Wranglerkiez and Kotti.

- **Wranglerkiez**, which has great access to pubs, live music, bars, and is a short bike away from some of Berlin’s most popular techno hotspots. There are a few hostels to choose from in this area, but not much in the way of boutique or upmarket accomodation.
- **Kotti**, in and around Oranienstraße, which has a definite edgy feel to it, and loads of good restaurants, cafés and bars.

If you’re looking for some fantastic nightlife and an edgy crowd, definitely stay in east part of Kreuzberg, around Köttbusser Tor, Görlitzer Bahnhof, and Schlesisches Tor on the U1 U-Bahn line.

Still somewhat alternative, but far more gentrified than the east, is the west part of Kreuzberg (SO36). **Bergmannkiez** (running between Mehringdamm and Südstern) is probably your best bet for a short-term visit to Berlin if you want to stay in SO36. It has loads of cute shops and cafés and a great market. This kiez is the least gritty and most gentrified area in Kreuzberg.

.

#### 4-Star in the Heart of East Kreuzberg (Kotti/Kreuzberg 61)

[**8.1 / 10 on Booking.com**](https://www.wandertooth.com/lf9e)

[**Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten Berlin City**](https://www.wandertooth.com/lf9e) — A fantastic location right in the heart of Kreuzberg’s action, this hotel offers upmarket feel amidst the sea of counter outside your windows. If you stay here, you won’t be wanting for places to eat, bars, and cafés, including Santa Maria, an insanely popular Mexican place (go on Tuesdays for cheap eats and tequila!). Plus, it’s right on the metro for anywhere you want to go. When I checked prices on Booking.com, I found rooms starting around USD $90-100 per night in off season.

Check Availability & Prices on

**[*Booking.com*](https://www.wandertooth.com/lf9e)**     /     ***[Trip Advisor](https://www.wandertooth.com/xhe6)*****

#### Boutique Cool in West Kreuzberg/SO36

[**8.4 / 10 on Booking.com**](https://www.wandertooth.com/ceff)

[**Hotel Sarotti-Höfe**](https://www.wandertooth.com/ceff) — Set in a former chocolate factory in the cute Bergmannkiez area of Kreuzberg, past guests rave about this hotel. Clean, comfortable and quiet, and in a great location with more of a local vibe than Mitte and more of an upmarket vibe than east Kreuzberg, it’s served by both the U6 and U7, which is just a few steps away.

### **Friedrichshain**: Get an East-Berlin Vibe

**Top hotel recommendations in Friedrichshain**: *[**nhow Berlin**](https://www.wandertooth.com/4hr7)** **(4-Star Design & Music Hotel) and [**Holiday Inn Berlin**](https://www.wandertooth.com/beo2) (looks way cooler than a typical Holiday Inn!)*

Friedrichshain is where the biggest chunk of the Berlin Wall — the East Side Gallery — survives today, and another good neighborhood to stay in if you’re interested in East Berlin history. For those seeking rowdier distractions, Friedrichshain is (apparently – because we’re too old for clubbing!) home to Berlin’s best clubs.

If you want to stay somewhere with an artsy-alternative vibe, want to be close to Berlin’s best clubs, or are interested in digging into many of former East Berlin’s biggest attractions, such as the Eastside Gallery, check out Friedrichshain.

#### 4-Star Design (& Music) Hotel

[**8.7 / 10 on Booking.com**](https://www.wandertooth.com/sq78)

[**nhow Berlin**](https://www.wandertooth.com/sq78) — This hotel looks exceedingly cool. To start with, it’s a music hotel with electric guitars, keyboards, or DJ set-ups you can borrow. Yep – you can have a DJ set-up delivered to your room to rock out. Even though I have absolutely no musical talent, I REALLY WANT TO DO THIS. Other features: in-room Nespresso machines, heated floors, rain shower, and an interior designed by Karim Rashid.

#### Fancy Holiday Inn

[**8.8 / 10 on Booking.com**](https://www.wandertooth.com/0mnj)

[**Holiday Inn Berlin** ](https://www.wandertooth.com/0mnj)— Holiday Inn doesn’t exactly scream “boutique,” but this one seems to be doing a great job. This property gets fantastic reviews, and has a design boutique-ish look on the inside, if not the exterior (which is pretty plain looking).

### **Neukölln**: Hang With the Locals

**Top hotel recommendation in Neukölln**: *[**Hüttenpalast**](https://www.wandertooth.com/2mh8)** **(Uber cool quirky boutique hotel)*

Edgy like Kreuzberg, Neukölln is a bit more out of the way, meaning it hasn’t become as popular with tourists quite yet. If you want to experience that Berlin edginess, and blend in like a local in a relatively residential area, Neukölln is the place to do it.

A huge plus of staying in Neukölln, in our opinion, is the proximity to Tempelhof, a former airport that closed down in 2008 and was converted to a huge park. On nice weekend afternoons, Tempelhof is filled with people hanging out in the park, kite surfing on the old runways, and playing soccer or frisbee.

#### Quirky, Cool Boutique Hotel

[**4.5 / 5 on Trip Advisor**](https://www.wandertooth.com/6bzh)

[**Hüttenpalast**](https://www.wandertooth.com/gsyn) — This place — which offers indoor “camping” in Retro caravans — just looks so quintessentially Berlin. I 100% want to stay here next time we go to Berlin. Seriously – look at the pictures on Booking.com – this is just such a strange and appealing concept, and so very Berlin!

# Looking for the Most Convenient Spot in Berlin? Stay In Mitte

### **Mitte**: Stay Right in the Centre of Sight-Seeing Action

**Top hotel recommendations in Mitte**: ***[Hotel Casa Camper](https://www.wandertooth.com/aa4p)**** **(Luxury quirky boutique hotel), **[Hotel Gat Point Charlie](https://www.wandertooth.com/5m7a)** (affordable boutique),** [Boutique Hotel i31 Berlin Mitte](https://www.wandertooth.com/ii1w)** (affordable boutique), **[Grimm’s Hotel am Potsdamer Platz](https://www.wandertooth.com/yzr8) **(cool and affordable design hotel), **[art’otel Berlin Mitte](https://www.wandertooth.com/1vdl) **(upscale design hotel).*

Mitte has a reputation for being chic, but compared to other European cities it’s far from pretentious. Offering fantastic dining, boutique hotels, plenty of art galleries, Mitte is about as commercial as Berlin dares to get. It’s also in proximity to some of Berlin’s most historic sites. From here you can walk to Museum Island, take a tour of the Reichstag, stroll along the famous Unter Den Linden, all the way to the mighty Brandenburg Gate.

For a slightly more upmarket experience in Berlin, stay in Mitte.

#### Luxury Boutique

[**9.5 / 10 on Booking.com**](https://www.wandertooth.com/ct9v)

**[Hotel Casa Camper](https://www.wandertooth.com/ct9v) **— This hotel is nailing it – another one of those *I want to stay here right now and I never want to leave *hotels. Reviews are absolutely glowing as well, with points for location, design, top-floor lounge, comfort, and free snacks!  When I check prices on Booking.com, rooms seem to run between US $190 to $250. This one is on my “dream hotels Berlin” mental list.

[**Hotel Gat Point Charlie **](https://www.wandertooth.com/lt1h)— This is one of the few hotels on this list we have personal experience with! We stayed here a few summers ago on a short weekend trip, and loved it. It’s upscale with quirky (military-cat-themed…yes you read that right) touches. We really enjoyed our time at this hotel, and would absolutely stay there again: great location, good value, great wifi, comfy beds, and beautiful, but with a sense of humour! When I check prices on Booking.com, I can find rooms starting around US $90 per night.

#### A Few More Hotel Options in Mitte…

The thing about this area of Berlin, is there’s lots of choice. If you haven’t fallen in love with the options above,  give these a try:

- **[Grimm’s Hotel am Potsdamer Platz](https://www.wandertooth.com/xbg7) **– Really cool looking design hotel with cool decor and great reviews. Rooms can be had for less than USD $100. ([Booking.com](https://www.wandertooth.com/xbg7) I [TripAdvisor Reviews](https://www.wandertooth.com/q02b))
- [**art’otel Berlin Mitte**](https://www.wandertooth.com/wdyh) – Nice looking hotel closer to the Kreuzberg end of Mitte, and close to the river. Great looking rooms with design touches, and hotel decor featuring a local artist. ([Booking.com](https://www.wandertooth.com/wdyh) I [TripAdvisor Reviews](https://www.wandertooth.com/0by4))

.

### Also Check Out Wedding…

Declared Berlin’s [hottest new neighborhood by Business Insider in 2015](http://www.businessinsider.com/berlins-hottest-new-neighborhood-2015-8), Wedding is working-class and immigrant neighborhood that is just now starting to become gentrified, like so many of its sister neighborhoods before it. In the 18th century, Wedding served as Berlin’s gambling and red light district, before becoming a low-income neighbourhood for working-class Germans and immigrants in the 19th century. Post-war, Wedding became part of the French part of West Berlin, with its southern border along Bernauer Straße butting against the Soviet sector.

Stay in Wedding if you want multicultural-meets-hipster, combining street art, man buns, beards, and artists, with shops and services from around the world, and are looking for rough-around-the-edges cool.

# Looking For Old West German Glamour, Cute Bars, and Beautiful Buildings? Stay in Schöneberg

### **Schöneberg**

**Top hotel recommendations in Schöneberg**: ***[Crowne Plaza](https://www.wandertooth.com/rvly) **or** [Riu Plaza](https://www.wandertooth.com/pr7x)**** **(4-star chain hotels), **[Motel One Berlin-Tiergarten](https://www.wandertooth.com/raue)** (3-star chain hotels), **[Hotel ibis Berlin Kurfuerstendamm](https://www.wandertooth.com/z19h)**** **(Cheap and Cheerful 2-Star)*

Schöneberg means “beautiful mountain” and its glamorous turn-of-the-century buildings, wide open boulevards, and cute bars once housed some of Berlin’s most famous foreigners including David Bowie and Nick Cave. Hidden art galleries, churches that double as live music venues, and enticing cafes make it a perfect neighbourhood for relaxing with a glass of wine and mingling with local residents. Despite all the cultural attractions, Schöneberg remains blissfully quiet and is also well connected to Kreuzberg, keeping you close to the action.

### International Chain Hotels

Schöneberg has a wide variety of international chain hotels, and many of the familiar players have a property in the area. These ones look like the best value at the time of research…

**[Motel One Berlin-Tiergarten](https://www.wandertooth.com/6848) **— Forget the “Motel” in the name, and give this property a chance. It’s really cool looking, and like the ibis, it’s channeling a boutique hotel feel, despite being a chain hotel. 24-hour lounge, beautiful, and great location – what’s not to like?

Typically, we try to stay in locally-owned or boutique-style properties, but as far as chain hotels go, ibis does a great job and really manages to capture that boutique, design hotel vibe, at a great price. This one appears to be no different: awesome reviews, great location, nice-looking decor. When I check prices on Booking.com, I can find rooms starting around US $75 per night.

# Looking For high-end restaurants, cafés and shops, and beautiful pre-war buildings? Charlottenburg might be the best area in Berlin for you!

### **Charlottenburg**

Home to Berlin’s largest surviving royal palace (yes – really!) Charlottenburg is the very definition of upmarket Berlin. Up until the second decade of the 20th century, Charlottenburg was a separate town from Berlin, and during the last decades of its freedom, it developed into a centre of high-culture entertainment – think theaters, grand cafés, shopping, wide boulevards and green spaces, all filled with the bourgeois Berliners and culture-shaping intellectuals such as Bertold Brecht. Prior to Germany’s division, Charlottenburg was the heart of West Berlin, and today it retains its upmarket feel.

Stay in Charlottenburg if you want a genteel and quiet residential vibe, all while having access to high-end restaurants, cafés and shops, and beautiful pre-war buildings.

# Cheryl's Recommendation for the Best Place to Stay in Berlin

### So…Where Should You Stay in Berlin?

If I had friends coming to stay in Berlin for only a few days up to a week, I’d recommend them to stay in Prenzlauer Berg (family-friendly chill), Kreuzberg (edgy nightlife), or Mitte (close to everything).

For the most part, Berlin is a very safe city. Staying inside the ring (ringbahn) and close to a U-bahn station means you’re well connected, wherever you may decide to stay.

I hope you found my neighbourhood guide helpful! If you’re still wondering where to stay in Berlin, or have any questions, please leave a comment or send us a tweet.

And if you’re looking for things to do while you’re visiting the city, visit Cheryl’s small, but constantly updated list of [things to do in Berlin](http://cherylhoward.com/berlin/things-to-do-in-berlin/)!

### Where to Stay in Berlin Map

To make it a little easier for you to find the best area to stay in Berlin, I’ve created a google map. Each neighbourhood is color-coded, and the (affiliate) link to the hotel is in the description, which will take you straight to Booking.com to check availability and prices. Click on the icon to the left of the map title to see the legend, which breaks recommendations down by neighbourhood! Hopefully this is helpful – I’ll continue to update it when I find the time :)

I stayed at the Westin in Berlin – admittedly not the best Westin I’ve ever stayed at, but the location was very convenient to seeing all the landmarks that you’d want to see.

Stayed at the Melia close to Friedrichstrasse station. Well located and within walking distance of most of the major sites. Was good value for money due to January sale.

Awesome tip, Alex! Thanks so much for sharing, and hope you had a good time in Berlin. I checked out [the Melia](https://www.wandertooth.com/wpqr) and it does seem to get great reviews :)
