A *[recent opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/opinion/college-board-sat-ap.html)* in the *New York Times *discussed how the College Board is pushing for students to focus on mastering “two codes” — computer science and the US Constitution — but are those truly the right areas of focus? In the article, columnist Thomas Friedman spoke with College Board President David Coleman and chief of global policy Stefanie Sanford about why the organization (which produces the PSAT, SAT, and SATII standardized tests and AP classes and exams) had chosen those two areas of focus. Although I agree in principle that these ‘two codes’ are useful, there are more than a few areas that, in my opinion, need to be addressed before computer science.

** 1.   General knowledge & cultural literacy**

The average American’s lack of general knowledge is a source of endless entertainment to the late-night-tv hosts, but it can also be a major roadblock to learning and participating thoughtfully in society. Two-thirds of young people in the US cannot find the UK on a map, according to a 2002 National Geographic survey. *[One-third cannot find the Pacific Ocean.](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/11/geography-survey-illiteracy/)* The concept that there are facts and concepts that everyone should know *[has been controversial](https://www.politico.com/magazine/politico50/2014/ive-been-a-pariah-for-so-long.html#.XGXYR89KhTY)*, but an overall lack of *[general knowledge about the world leads to issues with literacy and reading comprehension](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nataliewexler/2018/04/25/the-one-big-mistake-people-make-about-the-common-core/#4fea67699e56)* in general—not to mention the ability to spot misleading or untrue news stories, learn new things, and obtain more general knowledge.

** 2. Financial literacy/everyday math**

Our high schools are producing students who know multivariable calculus but don’t understand the concepts of marginal tax rates, compounding interest, or even how to quickly calculate a tip or keep their credit under control. *[Only five states require that high schoolers take a full semester of financial literacy instruction](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/your-money/states-financial-literacy-classes.html)*. This should obviously be higher, especially when one in five Americans has a net worth of zero or a negative net worth. But this should extend beyond personal finance—the average American doesn’t have a strong sense of *[wealth distribution](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2014/09/americans_have_no_idea_how_bad_inequality_is_new_harvard_business_school.html)*, basic global economics, and other financial issues that informed voters should be aware of.

** 3. Computer literacy**

Coding and computer science can be incredibly useful skills, but simply being fluent in the everyday operation of a computer must come first. As someone who works with teenagers, you’d be surprised how many young people are lost when it comes to learning to use new programs, navigating less-intuitive websites, configuring their privacy settings, and even using Google to do proper research. This may seem backward, considering that Generation Z are considered “digital natives,” but it makes sense—as mobile devices gain features and become more intuitive, fewer people encounter issues that require them to dive deep into their device’s settings or learn to muddle through unintuitive interfaces. The potential fallout of this is huge—the less we understand our own technology, the less control we have over it.

** 4. Life skills**

A student can — and there are students who do — make it to college without knowing how to boil water, change a car tire, drive a car, properly wash dishes, sew on a button, use a hammer and screwdriver, or even do laundry. Somehow in the backlash to the gendered-ness of traditional home economics and shop classes, we forgot that they taught useful skills that all students should learn, regardless of gender. Home economics has been rebranded as family and consumer sciences (FCS) and has *[continued to decline](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/06/opinion/revive-home-economics-classes-to-fight-obesity.html)* over the decades, despite the importance of these skills and the fact that learning how to *[cook in high school could be a vital to fighting the obesity crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/06/opinion/revive-home-economics-classes-to-fight-obesity.html)*.

But the life skills that are no longer being studied in most high schools extend beyond home ec/FCS — for one, *[driver’s ed has been on the decline](https://psmag.com/economics/why-poor-people-and-poc-dont-take-drivers-ed)* as costs increase. Not only does being able to drive enable teenagers to get jobs further away from home, but I think it’s likely that being able to more easily spend time with friends in person would reduce time spent on social media and reduce isolation and that increased formal driving instruction would reduce traffic collisions.

** 5. Grit, character, and emotional intelligence**

In *How Children Succeed, *Paul Tough makes the argument that schools and families must balance cognitive skills with non-cognitive skills or character strengths like grit, conscientiousness, and growth mindsets. He also speaks compellingly on the mental and physical toll that toxic stress takes on students. I’m not arguing for AP Conscientiousness, *[and neither is Tough](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/books/review/helping-children-succeed-by-paul-tough.html)*—many of the changes needed to help students develop the strength of character to succeed cannot be addressed by changes in curriculum, but rather more supportive and positive school environments. The role of a positive school environment is something I was very focused on when I was working on *[Facebook’s inspirED program](https://inspired.fb.com/about/)*, and it’s something that often must be handled on the administrative and school level. If *[increased police presence and searches lead to lower test scores](https://chalkbeat.org/posts/us/2019/02/14/police-schools-research-parkland/)*, then the opposite should also be true—students perform better in environments where they feel safe and trusted.

However, there are also curriculum changes that can improve students’ soft skills and non-cognitive abilities. The [Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence](http://ei.yale.edu/), where I worked as a research assistant, has a program called RULER that teaches children and educators the basic framework of emotional intelligence, from recognizing when they have a feeling to regulating their emotions throughout the day. Emotional intelligence is a learnable skill—you can increase your EQ in ways that you simply cannot increase your IQ—and it’s a skill that teenagers could benefit the most from. Moreover, I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that the world would be a better place if more people understood their own feelings and those of others.

None of this is to say that there is no point in teaching computer science (or the Constitution) to high school students. Some might argue that the above-mentioned areas should be the responsibility of parents, not schools—but if parents had a handle on teaching these skills in childhood, [why do adult millennials feel the need to take “adulting” classes to learn how to handle emotions or cook](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/adulting-classes-teach-millennials-basic-skills-like-sewing-cooking-and-how-to-deal-with-relationships/)? If we had a school system that already covered these five areas, I would agree that the next step should be coding—and I agree that the Constitution and founding documents should be more of a focus. That being said, I think that knowing how to code is less important than how to use a computer to adjust your Facebook privacy settings or cook a healthy meal or appropriately express your emotions and recognize emotions in others.
