Description

JOE PURDY - "Miss me"

Some movie star told you this ain't where it's at. So you packed your bags and one night you headed out. Said, these small town blues got you going insane gone into the city, gonna change your name and you never look back at where you came swore you'll never be the same.

Do you miss me? Do you miss me?

You're a big girl now, got your big shoes and you're running around with big girl blues and I know you don't doubt yourself anymore no, when you feel like leaving, walk out the door and I bet you ain't got nothin left to learn it's better that way cause you never get burned and you try not to think about what might have been cause you know this town is just sink or swim

Do you miss me? Do you miss me? Do you miss me?

Well the last time I say you were waving goodbye from the back of the train with a tear in your eye.

Now I hear you're in love with some big city man and together you're making your big city plans and you hope he don't find out about who you are that we used to catch fireflies in mason jars and we used to go down to the county fair and we listened to blue grass in summer air and we danced all night as the rain came down and you held my hand as we slept on the ground and we wrote our names in the old oak wood I guess some things don't work out like they should.

Do you miss me? Do you miss me? Do you miss me? Do you miss me? Do you miss me? yeah... Do you miss me?
