They're gonna know I'm dumb!

**They’re gonna know I’m dumb!**

11 years at Google on Monday. Instead of navel gazing on a list of things I have learned, here’s a list of things I’ve either never learned, or never done.

These are a few of the things that trigger my imposter syndrome:

1) **I’ve never used a binary tree.** So much of our time in interviews is having people create complicated data structures, and I’ve never once used or created one. Sure there are parts of my code which are built on things which are built on things which may use a tree, but if I ever find myself using anything other than a basic struct, a hashmap, a list (or a stream()), then I stop, because I’m making it more complicated than it needed to be... and yet, we keep asking these tricky questions in interviews...

2) **I’ve never built my own computer.** I know very very little about hardware. I’ve never built a gaming computer, I buy the latest mac every time it comes out and I hide my secret shame. When my work computer breaks, I panic and run to Tech Stop, and they hold my hand and help me nurse it back to life. The same is true for my phone, which I work on directly!

3) **I’ve never done a home coding project.** I’ve STARTED a few, once or twice, but I don’t code at home. No games. No home automation. I once got a sensor to work in an arduino board, but it was a single sensor and it didn’t really work well enough to do anything with. If I ever get the itch to code, it’s too easy to fix bugs in my work codebase.

4) **I’ve never worked on open source.** This is obvious given I’ve never done a home coding project, but I barely know what is going on in open source. Google lets me make the kinds of changes I want to see in the world. That’s remained true my entire time here. Being clear, I get that others feel different. They aren’t wrong to. Open source is great, but it’s just not something I’ve ever done or really understand.

5) **I’ve never published an academic paper, or anything close to one.** I read a white paper once, when interviewing for Google I read about stubby and map reduce. But that’s it. That’s the closest I’ve ever come.

6) **I’ve never read a technical manual or book on coding (this includes college).** I don’t read non-fiction at all. I’ve tried. Closest I have ever come was the Gang of Four’s book on Design Patterns. But I didn’t read the book, I just skimmed the chapters, saw the pictures and then taught a class on it (how’s that for being a fraud).

Why am I saying all of this instead of a long winded skreed on what I’ve learned in 11 years on how to be a Google Software Engineer?

Because this IS what I’ve learned. Everything above is just one way of being. They are effective ways, and they work for some people! But just because I don’t present with the features that people recognize. It didn’t stop me from being curious, passionate, and technical.

So when you suffer from imposter syndrome (and you will).

Take a breath, look at what triggered it and ask:

Who is it that I think I am not? What do I have, that that person doesn’t?

The answer to that question is where your strengths are. Use them.
