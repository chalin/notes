 I use pictures to illustrate the mechanics of "Bayes' rule," a mathematical theorem about how to update your beliefs as you encounter new evidence. Then I tell three stories from my life that show how I use Bayes' rule to improve my thinking.

 I've done a lot of repair work, and I know what's it's like to be in the category: "looks like he's going to rob you but really he's just doing his job." Let me tell you - every place is built differently, and you should always keep your eyes open.. One time I found a gas line going into a bedroom and not even capped off. The place would have filled up with explosives at the turn of a knob, well if not for my "snooping about" that is. But it's also part of the job description to not freak people out. I just said, "I need to look around a bit to make sure I know where all the gas lines are going."

 I think people should learn Bayesian from its statistical development. Bayesian method in psychology is just scratch the surface.

 Problem #1: When an accident happens, what is the probability that the accident is caused by a bad driver, given that:

1) 90% of the population has been involved in at least one accident 2) 30% of the population are bad drivers (means 70% are good drivers) 3) 99% of the bad drivers are involved in at least one accident

P(Bad Driver) = 0.3 p(Accident|Bad Driver) = probability of a bad driver causing an accident = 0.99 P(Accident) = 0.9

P(Bad Driver|Accident) = probability of an accident caused by a bad driver = 0.99 * 0.3 / 0.9 = 0.33 = 33%

When an accident happens, there is only 33% chance that the accident is caused by a bad driver.

Problem #2: Find the chance of having cancer, given that the customer is 65 years old.

Facts: (a) 1% of the population have cancer (99% don't have cancer) (b) 0.2% of the population is 65 years old (c) Of those that have cancer, 0.5% of them are 65 years old

P(Cancer) = 0.01 P(65 yr old) = 0.002 P(65 yr old | Cancer) = 0.005

P(Cancer | 65 yr old) = What percent of the 65 year old population is likely to have cancer = P (65 yr old | Cancer ) * P (Cancer) / P(65 yr old) = 0.005 * 0.01 /0.002 = 0.025

Only 2.5% of the 65 year old population is likely to have cancer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem #3: Given the following:

(a) 1% of the population have breast cancer (99% don't) (b) 80% of the mammograms detect breast cancer (20% don't) (c) 9.6% of the mammograms detect breast cancer when it's not there (90.4% of the tests correctly return a negative result).

You have got a positive result.What are the chances that you have breast cancer?

P(Breast Cancer|Positive Result) is what we have to find.

P(Breast Cancer) = 0.01 P(Positive Result|Breast Cancer) = 0.8 P(Positive Result) = We need to consider both positive and false positive = Positive + False Positive = You have breast cancer and you have been correctly identified as having breast cancer + You don't have breast cancer but have been identified as having breast cancer = 0.01 * 0.8 + 0.99 * 0.096 = 0.10304

P(Breast Cancer|Positive Result) = 0.8 * 0.01 / 0.10304 = 0.0776

So, if you have a positive result, there is only 7.76% that you have breast cancer.

 There is so much evidence that medication / mindfulness works that you're gonna need a bigger chart. Here's 2 seconds worth of googling[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_on_meditation﻿](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FResearch_on_meditation&redir_token=hydfu43dt65FbS9WTIZXNNqNFId8MTUxODA5MDMyMkAxNTE4MDAzOTIy)

 Quite bizarre hypotheses about the "fakeness" or "realness" of meditation. To me it's always seemed as simply a subjective experience one encounters, and which one certainly knows about when encountered. People who try and stamp a rationalist perspective on mediation are likely to run out of steam quite quickly.

 Few weeks before Bob complained about Alice:
Bob: Hey Alice, I got something personal to ask you.
Alice: (Oh my God, is he proposing to me?)
Bob: Do you think Julia and I should date?
Alice: Ummm....nope, not really
Bob: What? Why is that? We both like maths and she is smart and pretty.

Alice: Yea she is smart and pretty but look at you, you're bald, fat, in yr mid 40s and still living with your parents when you do your PHD

Bob: Woow...Alice calm down, I thought we were friends.

Alice: You can't even finish your thesis, how about you do that before thinking about Julia you ugly fat f@@k.

(Alice leaves canteen in a rush with tears)
Julia: [6:15﻿](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK7X_XlGB8&t=375s)

 How do you assign probabilities to something like "meditation works?" There is no definition of what constitutes achieving a meditative state, and no precise goal of self-improvement that might be fostered by the practice. Coherent terms matter. Also, the assumption that one's "priors" were, themselves, correct is questionable. I'm not saying the Bayesian principle isn't useful; you just have to remember its limitations.

 This seems like a good way to justify your position while also being wrong. I like it.
