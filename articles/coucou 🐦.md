Channel your inner Bach, and harmonize with a machine learning model!

* * *

The model is trained to fill in missing portions of 4-part Bach chorales. Here are a few things you can try:

- **Draw** a melody in any of the voices (painted with different colours:   ). Each voice has a range and not all voices can be drawn for all the pitches (the legend on the right side should help with that!)

- Have the model **fill in** voices that are missing

- Use the **Limit fill** tool to mask out a section of the resulting piece and have the model to only fill in that part

Built with [magenta.js](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/). Learn more about [how it works](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/coconet), or see the code on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/coconet).
