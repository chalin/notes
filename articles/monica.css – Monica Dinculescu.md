Back in the day when I worked on Polymer I got used to relying on a bunch of useful CSS classes that at the time we called [iron-flex-layout](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/blob/master/iron-flex-layout-classes.js). They were there partly because flexbox was a sadness on IE and you needed to say everything 3 times to maybe get it right twice, and add some very special `flex-basis: 0.000000001px;`“bug fixes” that tbh nobody should ever have to write by hand. But they were also there because it’s kind of nice to say `<div class="horizontal">` and for it to just work.

Some years later, it’s now 2020, and flexbox is really good everywhere! We don’t need `iron-flex-layout` anymore, but tbh I still want to say `<div class="horizontal">` and for it to just work.

I know there are tons of CSS frameworks out there like [tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) that can do this for me, but most of these frameworks do *too much* for me. I don’t work on large projects that need design systems, and I don’t want every possible padding and margin and colour and flexbox configuration in the world. I just want the ones that I know I end up using in every project. So here is `monica.css`: my very own CSS framework, which I copy paste at the beginning of every CSS file and take it from there. It’s already minified and bundled (because you copy pasted it) so dare I say: fast loading and efficient?

	* {*box-sizing*: border-box}
	[hidden] {*display*: none !important}
	[disabled] {*pointer-events*:none; *opacity*: 0.3}
	.horizontal {*display*: flex; *flex-direction*: row; *justify-content*: space-between}
	.vertical {*display*: flex; *flex-direction*: column}
	.center {*justify-content*: center; *align-items*: center}
	.flex {*flex*: 1}
	html {
	  --spacing-xs: 8px;
	  --spacing: 24px;
	  --spacing-s: 12px;
	  --spacing-m: 36px;
	}
