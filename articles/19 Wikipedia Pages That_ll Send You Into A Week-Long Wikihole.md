###   We recently asked members of the [BuzzFeed Community](http://buzzfeed.com/community) to tell us which Wikipedia articles they [love to waste time reading](https://www.buzzfeed.com/eleanorbate/the-best-wikipedia-page-to-waste-time-reading?utm_term=.egOOKaOav5#.lwQPdxPxYg). Here are their recommendations...

###   1.  [Unit 731](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Feleanorbate%2Flist-of-lists-of-lists-of-lists&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FUnit_731&xcust=4353934%7CDESKTOP&xs=1)

Suggested by [Lurker8](https://www.buzzfeed.com/lurker8).

Unit 731 was a unit of the Japanese Imperial Army that carried out brutal (and, in many cases, lethal) experimentation on human beings during World War II under the guise of chemical and biological research. For the majority of the time it was active, the unit acted under the command of General Shiro Ishii, and was responsible for the deaths of up to 250,000 people. The worst part? Instead of being put on trial for human experimentation, the people involved with the unit were granted immunity by the US government in exchange for the data they had gathered.

###   2.  [The Disappearance of Natalee Holloway](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Feleanorbate%2Flist-of-lists-of-lists-of-lists&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDisappearance_of_Natalee_Holloway&xcust=4353934%7CDESKTOP&xs=1)

Suggested by [onemellocello](https://www.buzzfeed.com/onemellocello).

In 2005 Natalee Holloway, an 18-year-old from Mountain Brook, Alabama, disappeared during her high school graduation trip to Aruba. She was last seen in a car with three men – Joran van der Sloot, Deepak Kalpoe, and Satish Kalpoe. While each of the men has been arrested several times in connection with Natalee's disappearance, they were always released due to lack of evidence. Exactly five years to the day after Natalee's disappearance, 21-year-old Stephany Tatiana Flores Ramírez went missing in Peru. Her dead body was discovered three days later in a hotel room registered to Joran van der Sloot. While Van der Sloot pleaded guilty to Ramírez's murder, Natalee Holloway's disappearance remains unsolved.

This list is basically what it says on the tin: a bunch of facts that you think you know but aren't really facts at all. For example, I was upset to learn that Thomas Crapper (the guy in the above photo) didn't actually invent the flushing toilet. He just made them more popular. Also, less surprisingly, Einstein didn't really fail maths, and when he heard this claim he said "before I was 15 I had mastered differential and integral calculus." No need to brag, Albert.

This article is really long, can keep you occupied for hours, and is a great resource for when you want to get all "well, actually..." at parties.

On 18 November 1978, almost a thousand people – most of them American – in a remote commune in Jonestown, Guyana, died of apparent cyanide poisoning. They were all members of the [Peoples Temple](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Feleanorbate%2Flist-of-lists-of-lists-of-lists&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPeoples_Temple&xcust=4353934%7CDESKTOP&xs=1), a religious organisation led by [Jim Jones](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Feleanorbate%2Flist-of-lists-of-lists-of-lists&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJim_Jones&xcust=4353934%7CDESKTOP&xs=1) that has since been referred to as a cult. The deaths at the commune were viewed as a mass suicide, though survivors consider it to be mass murder. Oh, and if that wasn't enough, there's a whole Wikipedia article on the [conspiracy theories](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Feleanorbate%2Flist-of-lists-of-lists-of-lists&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJonestown_conspiracy_theories&xcust=4353934%7CDESKTOP&xs=1) surrounding the incidents.

This specific article is basically just a list of all the monarchs Britain has ever had (spoiler alert: it's a lot) and their families. It's all organised by the different family trees, and it's honestly really detailed and confusing – but there are so many links there that you can fall into a days-long Wiki hole. You won't even recognise yourself in the mirror when you come out the other side.

(Psst... If you want something a bit easier to get into, there's always the [List of English Monarchs](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Feleanorbate%2Flist-of-lists-of-lists-of-lists&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FList_of_English_monarchs&xcust=4353934%7CDESKTOP&xs=1).)

A feral child is basically a person who has lived in isolation from human contact from a young age, and therefore has no experience of human behaviour. Again, this article itself is more of a wormhole into an infinity of ridiculously interesting articles you won't be able to stop reading. I once spent an entire night reading about [Genie](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Feleanorbate%2Flist-of-lists-of-lists-of-lists&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FGenie_%28feral_child%29&xcust=4353934%7CDESKTOP&xs=1) (the girl in the photos), who until the age of 13 was kept locked alone in a room by her father. Upon being rescued from her abusive family home, Genie was taken into government care and became the subject of examinations and research into human behaviour. Her article alone (and the documentary you can find [on YouTube](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Feleanorbate%2Flist-of-lists-of-lists-of-lists&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgJ5Vrc4lJmQ&xcust=4353934%7CDESKTOP&xs=1)) are enough to keep you occupied for hours.

This is a short one, but if you don't know about it already, you absolutely *have to* read it. In July 1518, in Strasbourg, France, a woman began to randomly and enthusiastically dance in the middle of the street. Within a month, 400 people were dancing. There are theories, but nobody can be certain why it happened. You just need to know about it.

While many of them don't have their own Wikipedia pages (there are hundreds of them, after all), the most interesting ones do, and there are enough to keep you entertained for days. There's no Jack or Rose though. Sorry.

It may be the happiest place on Earth, but there's some crazy shit that goes down at Disney World. So much crazy shit, in fact, that the incidents are organised both by Disney park and by the rides they occurred on.

Who *doesn't* want to spend their free time getting unreasonably frustrated by logic, am I right? The list of paradoxes is exactly what it sounds like – it's a compilation of scenarios considered to be paradoxes, and is the most annoying thing in the history of the internet. You'll want to figure out solutions to them all, but guess what? You can't. They're damn paradoxes.

Homer and Langley Collyer were brothers who lived in Harlem, New York, during the first half of the 20th century. They inherited their house on Fifth Avenue after their mother died, and after a few years they became withdrawn, isolating themselves from society. In March 1947, after an anonymous source complained about the smell coming from their house, the brothers' bodies were found surrounded by over 140 tonnes of obsessively hoarded books, furniture, and musical instruments – all of which was protected by booby traps to ward off intruders.

Not many people have attempted to climb Mount Everest, but even fewer have attempted it and actually succeeded – a lot of people have died along the way of anything from altitude sickness to injuries sustained during avalanches. This lists all of them dating all the way back to the 1920s, but what's interesting is that you can read into all their back stories.

If you're looking for something a little bit shorter and a lot more lighthearted, you need to read about the Great Emu War. It's exactly what it sounds like, which makes it even more amazing. Basically in the 1930s this guy decided that there were too many emus in Australia, and ordered a war against them. I'm not going to spoil the ending for you, though, because the ending is the best part.

If you don't know, mass hysteria is when a whole mass of people become hysterical about something, usually as a result of rumours spread within their society. This article collects a bunch of notable cases. A lot of them are really creepy, but some of them are pretty amusing – like the [Tanganyika laughter epidemic](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Feleanorbate%2Flist-of-lists-of-lists-of-lists&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTanganyika_laughter_epidemic&xcust=4353934%7CDESKTOP&xs=1), when around a hundred girls began laughing uncontrollably for days on end. It probably wasn't that funny for them, though.

The Gambino crime "family" is one of the main groups that dominates organised crime in New York City. This article goes deep into the history of the family, detailing the origins of the group and the reigns of all of its bosses. Which means you'll probably end up in a Mafia boss-based Wiki hole.

Apparently throughout history there have been a bunch of incidents of flightless animals falling from the sky – hence the term "rain of animals". This article documents some of these claims, from jellyfish rain in 1894 to just your average fish rain in 2016, but it also gives some actual explanations for why this could happen. For example, the picture above shows a tornado colliding with a group of flying bats. So it's not a weird, apocalyptic phenomenon after all. Mostly it's just tornadoes.
