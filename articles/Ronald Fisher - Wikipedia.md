**Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher**  [FRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-frs-4) (17 February 1890 – 29 July 1962) was a British [statistician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) and [geneticist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneticist). For his work in statistics, he has been described as "a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science"[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-Hald98-5) and "the single most important figure in 20th century statistics".[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-6) In genetics, his work used [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) to combine [Mendelian genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_genetics) and [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection); this contributed to the revival of [Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism) in the early 20th-century revision of the theory of [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) known as the [modern synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_synthesis_(20th_century)). For his contributions to biology, Fisher has been called "the greatest of Darwin’s successors".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-Edwards_pp._421%E2%80%93430-7)

From 1919 onward, he worked at the [Rothamsted Experimental Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothamsted_Research) for 14 years;[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-russ-8) there, he analysed its immense data from crop experiments since the 1840s, and developed the [analysis of variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance) (ANOVA). He established his reputation there in the following years as a [biostatistician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biostatistics).

He is known as one of the three principal founders of [population genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics). He outlined [Fisher's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_principle), the [Fisherian runaway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherian_runaway) and [sexy son hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexy_son_hypothesis) theories of [sexual selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection). His contributions to statistics include the [maximum likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood), [fiducial inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiducial_inference), the derivation of various sampling distributions, founding principles of the [design of experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments), and much more.

Fisher held strong views on [race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)). Throughout his life, he was a prominent supporter of [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics), an interest which led to his work on statistics and genetics.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-NewScientist-9) Notably, he was a dissenting voice in the 1950 [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO) statement *[The Race Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Race_Question)*, insisting on racial differences.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-UNESCO1952-10)

Inverforth House North End Way NW3, where Fisher lived from 1896 to 1904

Fisher was born in [East Finchley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Finchley) in [London, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London,_England), into a middle-class household; his father, George, was a successful partner in Robinson & Fisher, auctioneers and fine art dealers.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-Heritage-11) He was one of twins, with the other twin being still-born[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-12) and grew up the youngest, with three sisters and one brother.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-13) From 1896 until 1904 they lived at [Inverforth House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverforth_House) in London, where [English Heritage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Heritage) installed a [blue plaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_plaque) in 2002, before moving to [Streatham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streatham).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-BluePlaque-14) His mother, Kate, died from acute [peritonitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritonitis) when he was 14, and his father lost his business 18 months later.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-Heritage-11)

Lifelong poor eyesight caused his rejection by the [British Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army) for [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I),[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-Wiley-15) but also developed his ability to visualize problems in [geometrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry) terms, not in writing mathematical solutions, or proofs. He entered [Harrow School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School) age 14 and won the school's Neeld Medal in mathematics. In 1909, he won a scholarship to study [Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) at [Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonville_and_Caius_College,_Cambridge). In 1912, he gained a First in [Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-16) In 1915 he published a paper *The evolution of sexual preference*[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-17) on [sexual selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection) and [mate choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_choice).

## Career[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ronald_Fisher&action=edit&section=2)]

During 1913–1919, Fisher worked for six years as a statistician in the City of London and taught [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics) and maths at a sequence of [public schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_school_(UK)), at the [Thames Nautical Training College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Nautical_Training_College), and at [Bradfield College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradfield_College). There he settled with his new bride, Eileen Guinness, with whom he had two sons and six daughters.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-box-18)

In 1918 he published "[The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Correlation_Between_Relatives_on_the_Supposition_of_Mendelian_Inheritance)", in which he introduced the term [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) and proposed its formal analysis.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-19) He put forward a [genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics)  [conceptual model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model) showing that [continuous variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus) amongst [phenotypic traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait) measured by biostatisticians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes and thus be the result of [Mendelian inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance). This was the first step towards establishing [population genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics) and [quantitative genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_genetics), which demonstrated that [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection) could change [allele frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele_frequency) in a population, resulting in reconciling its discontinuous nature with gradual [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution).[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-20) Joan Box, Fisher's biographer and daughter says that Fisher had resolved this problem already in 1911.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-21)

### Rothamsted Experimental Station, 1919–1933[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ronald_Fisher&action=edit&section=3)]

In 1919, he began working at the [Rothamsted Experimental Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothamsted_Research) for 14 years,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-russ-8) where he analysed its immense data from crop experiments since the 1840s, and developed the [analysis of variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance) (ANOVA). In 1919, he was offered a position at the [Galton Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galton_Laboratory) in [University College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London) led by [Karl Pearson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pearson), but instead accepted a temporary job at Rothamsted in [Harpenden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpenden) to investigate the possibility of analysing the vast amount of crop data accumulated since 1842 from the "Classical Field Experiments". He analysed the data recorded over many years and in 1921, published *Studies in Crop Variation*, and his first application of the analysis of variance [ANOVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANOVA).[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-22) In 1928, [Joseph Oscar Irwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Oscar_Irwin) began a three-year stint at Rothamsted and became one of the first people to master Fisher's innovations. Between 1912 and 1922 Fisher recommended, analyzed (with flawed attempts at [proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof)) and vastly popularized [Maximum likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood).[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-23)

Rothamsted Research

Fisher's 1924 article *On a distribution yielding the error functions of several well known statistics* presented [Pearson's chi-squared test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test) and [William Gosset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sealy_Gosset)'s [Student's t-distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution) in the same framework as the [Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_distribution) and is where he developed [Fisher's z-distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_z-distribution) a new statistical method, commonly used decades later as the [F distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_distribution). He pioneered the principles of the [design of experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments) and the statistics of small samples and the analysis of real data.

In 1925 he published *[Statistical Methods for Research Workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_Methods_for_Research_Workers)*, one of the 20th century's most influential books on statistical methods.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-Conniffe-24)  [Fisher's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_method)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-26) is a technique for [data fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_fusion) or "[meta-analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis)" (analysis of analyses). This book also popularized the [p-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value), and plays a central role in his approach. Fisher proposes the level p=0.05, or a 1 in 20 chance of being exceeded by chance, as a limit for statistical significance, and applies this to a normal distribution (as a two-tailed test), thus yielding the rule of two standard deviations (on a normal distribution) for statistical significance.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-27) The [1.96](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1.96), the approximate value of the 97.5 percentile point of the normal distribution used in probability and statistics, also originated in this book.

> "The value for which P=0.05, or 1 in 20, is 1.96 or nearly 2 ; it is convenient to take this point as a limit in judging whether a deviation is to be considered significant or not."> [> [28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-28)

In Table 1 of the work, he gave the more precise value 1.959964.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-29)

In 1928, Fisher was the first to use [diffusion equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_equation) to attempt to calculate the distribution of [allele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele) frequencies and the estimation of [genetic linkage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage) by maximum likelihood methods among populations.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-30)

In 1930, *[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Genetical_Theory_of_Natural_Selection)* was first published by [Clarendon Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Press) and is dedicated to [Leonard Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Darwin). A core work of the neo-Darwinian [modern evolutionary synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_synthesis_(20th_century)),[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-31) it helped define [population genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics), which Fisher founded alongside [Sewall Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewall_Wright) and [J. B. S. Haldane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._S._Haldane), and revived Darwins neglected idea of [sexual selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection).[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-32) One of Fisher's favorite aphorisms was "Natural selection is a mechanism for generating an exceedingly high degree of improbability."[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-33)

Fisher's fame grew and he began to travel and lecture widely. In 1931, he spent six weeks at the Statistical Laboratory at [Iowa State College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_College) where he gave three lectures per week, and met many American statisticians, including [George W. Snedecor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Snedecor). He returned there again in 1936.[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

### University College London, 1933–39[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ronald_Fisher&action=edit&section=4)]

In 1933, Fisher became the head of the Department of [Eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics) at [University College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London).[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-34) In 1935, he published *[The Design of Experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Experiments)*, which was "also fundamental, [and promoted] statistical technique and application... The mathematical justification of the methods was not stressed and proofs were often barely sketched or omitted altogether .... [This] led [H.B. Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Mann) to fill the gaps with a rigorous mathematical treatment".[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-Conniffe-24)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-35) In this book Fisher also outlined the [Lady tasting tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_tasting_tea), now a famous [design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments) of a statistical [randomized experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_experiment) which uses [Fisher's exact test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_exact_test) and is the original exposition of Fisher's notion of a [null hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis).[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-36)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-37)

The same year he also published a paper on [fiducial inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiducial_inference)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-38)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-39) and applied it to the [Behrens–Fisher problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behrens%E2%80%93Fisher_problem), the solution to which, proposed first by [Walter Behrens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Behrens_(statistician)) and a few years later by Fisher, is the [Behrens–Fisher distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behrens%E2%80%93Fisher_distribution).

In 1936 he introduced the [Iris flower data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) as an example of [discriminant analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant_analysis).[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-40)

In his 1937 paper *The wave of advance of advantageous genes* he proposed [Fisher's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_equation) in the context of [population dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_dynamics) to describe the spatial spread of an advantageous [allele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele) and explored its travelling wave solutions.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-41) Out of this also came the [Fisher–Kolmogorov equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Kolmogorov_equation).[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-42)In 1937, he visited the [Indian Statistical Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Statistical_Institute) in Calcutta, and its one part-time employee, [P. C. Mahalanobis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._C._Mahalanobis), often returning to encourage its development. He was the guest of honour at its 25th anniversary in 1957, when it had 2000 employees.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-43)

In 1938, Fisher and [Frank Yates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Yates) described the [Fisher–Yates shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle) in their book *Statistical tables for biological, agricultural and medical research*.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-44) Their description of the algorithm used pencil and paper; a table of random numbers provided the randomness.

### University of Cambridge, 1940–1956[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ronald_Fisher&action=edit&section=5)]

In 1943, along with [A.S. Corbet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Steven_Corbet) and [C.B. Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.B._Williams) he published a paper on [relative species abundance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_species_abundance) where he developed the logseries to fit two different abundance data sets[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-45) In the same year he took the [Balfour Chair of Genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Chair_of_Genetics) where the Italian researcher [Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Luca_Cavalli-Sforza) was recruited in 1948, establishing a one-man unit of bacterial genetics.

In 1936, Fisher used a [Pearson's chi-squared test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test) to analyze Mendel's data and concluded that Mendel's results with the predicted ratios were far too perfect, suggesting that adjustments (intentional or unconscious) had been made to the data to make the observations fit the hypothesis.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-46) Later authors have claimed Fisher's analysis was flawed, proposing various statistical and botanical explanations for Mendel's numbers.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-47)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-48) In 1947, Fisher cofounded the journal *[Heredity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity_(journal))* with [Cyril Darlington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Darlington) and in 1949 he published *The Theory of Inbreeding.*

In 1950 he published "Gene Frequencies in a Cline Determined by Selection and Diffusion".[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-49) He developed computational [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) for analyzing data from his balanced experimental designs,[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-50) with various editions and translations, becoming a standard reference work for scientists in many disciplines. In [ecological genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_genetics) he and [E. B. Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._B._Ford) showed how the force of natural selection was much stronger than had been assumed, with many ecogenetic situations (such as [polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology))) being maintained by the force of selection.

During this time he also worked on mouse chromosome mapping; breeding the mice in laboratories in his own house.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-51)

Fisher publicly spoke out against the 1950 study showing that smoking [tobacco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco) causes [lung cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer), arguing that [correlation does not imply causation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation).[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-52)[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-53)[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-54)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-55)[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-56)[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-57) To quote his biographers Yates and Mather, "It has been suggested that the fact that Fisher was employed as consultant by the [tobacco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco) firms in this controversy casts doubt on the value of his arguments. This is to misjudge the man. He was not above accepting financial reward for his labours, but the reason for his interest was undoubtedly his dislike and mistrust of puritanical tendencies of all kinds; and perhaps also the personal solace he had always found in tobacco."[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-frs-4)

He gave the 1953 [Croonian lecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croonian_lecture) on population genetics.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-58)

In the winter of 1954–1955 Fisher met [Debabrata Basu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debabrata_Basu), the [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India) statistician who wrote in 1988, "With his reference set argument, Sir Ronald was trying to find a *[via media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_media)* between the two poles of Statistics – Berkeley and Bayes.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-59) My efforts to understand this Fisher compromise led me to the [likelihood principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_principle)".[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-60)

Memorial plaque over his remains, lectern-side aisle of St Peter's Cathedral, Adelaide

In 1957, a retired Fisher emigrated to [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia), where he spent time as a senior research fellow at the Australian [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research_Organisation) (CSIRO) in [Adelaide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide). He died there in 1962, and his remains were interred within [St Peter's Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Peter%27s_Cathedral,_Adelaide), Adelaide.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-61)

## Personal life and beliefs[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ronald_Fisher&action=edit&section=7)]

He married Eileen Guinness, with whom he had two sons and six daughters.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-box-18)His marriage disintegrated during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), and his older son George, an [aviator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator), was killed in combat.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-62) His daughter Joan, who wrote a biography of her father, married the statistician [George E. P. Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box).[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-63)

Stained glass window in the dining hall of [Caius College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonville_and_Caius_College,_Cambridge), in Cambridge, commemorating Ronald Fisher and representing a [Latin square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square), discussed by him in *[The Design of Experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Experiments)*

According to Yates and Mather, "His large family, in particular, reared in conditions of great financial stringency, was a personal expression of his genetic and evolutionary convictions."[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-frs-4) Fisher was noted for being loyal, and was seen as a patriot, a member of the [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England), politically [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative), as well as a scientific rationalist. He developed a reputation for carelessness in his dress and was the archetype of the absent-minded professor. [H. Allen Orr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Allen_Orr) describes him in the *Boston Review* as a "deeply devout [Anglican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican) who, between founding modern statistics and population genetics, penned articles for church magazines".[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-64) In a 1955 broadcast on Science and Christianity,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-frs-4) he said:

> The custom of making abstract dogmatic assertions is not, certainly, derived from the teaching of > [> Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus)> , but has been a widespread weakness among religious teachers in subsequent centuries. I do not think that the word for the Christian virtue of faith should be prostituted to mean the credulous acceptance of all such piously intended assertions. Much self-deception in the young believer is needed to convince himself that he knows that of which in reality he knows himself to be ignorant. That surely is hypocrisy, against which we have been most conspicuously warned.

### Parapsychology[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ronald_Fisher&action=edit&section=8)]

Fisher was involved with the [Society for Psychical Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Psychical_Research).[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-65)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-66)

### Eugenics[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ronald_Fisher&action=edit&section=9)]

[![RonaldFisher1912.jpg](../_resources/621ccf081c7d2de375154c79b502c187.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RonaldFisher1912.jpg)

[(L)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RonaldFisher1912.jpg)

As a steward at the First [International Eugenics Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Eugenics_Conference), 1912

In 1910 Fisher joined the [Eugenics Society (UK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_Society_(UK)) at University of Cambridge, whose members included [John Maynard Keynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes), [R. C. Punnett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._C._Punnett), and [Horace Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Darwin). He saw [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics) as addressing pressing social and scientific issues that encompassed and drove his interest in both genetics and statistics. During World War I Fisher started writing book reviews for the *Eugenic Review* and volunteered to undertake all such reviews for the journal, being hired for a part-time position.

The last third of *The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection* focussed on eugenics, attributing the fall of [civilizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization) to the fertility of their upper classes being diminished, and used British 1911 census data to show an inverse relationship between fertility and social class, partly due, he claimed, to the lower financial costs and hence increasing social status of families with fewer children. He proposed the abolition of extra allowances to large families, with the allowances proportional to the earnings of the father. He served in several official committees to promote eugenics. In 1934, he resigned from the Eugenics Society over a dispute about increasing the power of scientists within the movement.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-Adelaide-67)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-NewScientist-9)[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-Cruz-68)

### Race[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ronald_Fisher&action=edit&section=10)]

In 1950, Fisher opposed [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO)'s [The Race Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Race_Question), believing that evidence and everyday experience showed that human groups differ profoundly "in their innate capacity for intellectual and emotional development" and concluded that the "practical international problem is that of learning to share the resources of this planet amicably with persons of materially different nature", and that "this problem is being obscured by entirely well-intentioned efforts to minimize the real differences that exist". The revised statement titled "The Race Concept: Results of an Inquiry" (1951) was accompanied by Fisher's dissenting commentary.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-UNESCO1952-10)

## Legacy[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ronald_Fisher&action=edit&section=11)]

Fisher's former doctoral students include [Walter Bodmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bodmer),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-mathgene-2)  [D. J. Finney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._J._Finney),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-mathgene-2)  [Mary F. Lyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_F._Lyon)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-zimmer-3)and [C. R. Rao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._R._Rao)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-mathgene-2) Although a prominent opponent of [Bayesian statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics), Fisher was the first to use the term "Bayesian", in 1950.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-69) The 1930 *[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Genetical_Theory_of_Natural_Selection)* is commonly cited in biology books, and outlines many important concepts, such as:

- [Parental investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_investment), is any parental expenditure (time, energy etc.) that benefits one [offspring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring) at a cost to [parents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent)' ability to invest in other components of [fitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_(biology)),[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-Clutton-Brock1991-70)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-Trivers1972-71)
- [Fisherian runaway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherian_runaway), explaining how the desire for a [phenotypic trait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait) in one sex combined with the trait in the other sex (for example a [peacock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl)'s tail) creates a runaway development of the trait.
- [Fisher's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_principle), which explains why the [sex ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_ratio) is mostly 1:1 in nature.
- [Reproductive value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_value_(population_genetics)) which implies that [sexually reproductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction) value measures the contribution of an individual of a given age to the future growth of the [population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population).[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-72)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-73)
- [Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_fundamental_theorem_of_natural_selection), which states that "the rate of increase in [fitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_(biology)) of any [organism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism) at any time is equal to its [genetic variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variance) in fitness at that time."[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-Fisher-74)
- [Fisher's geometric model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_geometric_model), an [evolutionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) model of the [effect sizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size) on [fitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_(biology)) of spontaneous [mutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutations) proposed by Fisher to explain the distribution of effects of mutations that could contribute to [adaptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_(biology)) evolution.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-brief-history-75)
- [Sexy son hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexy_son_hypothesis), which hypothesizes that females may choose arbitrarily attractive male mates simply because they are attractive, thus increasing the attractiveness of their sons who attract more mates of their own. This is in contrast to theories of female mate choice based on the assumption that females choose attractive males because the attractive traits are markers of male fitness.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-76)
- [Mimicry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry), a similarity of one species to another that protects one or both
- [Dominance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)), a relationship between [alleles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele) of one [gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene), in which the effect on [phenotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype) of one allele masks the contribution of a second allele at the same [locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)).[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-77)
- [Heterozygote advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygote_advantage)[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-78) which was later found to play a frequent role in genetic polymorphism.
- Demonstrating that the probability of a mutation increasing the [fitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_(biology)) of an organism decreases proportionately with the magnitude of the mutation and that larger populations carry more variation so that they have a greater chance of survival.

Fisher is also known for:

- [Linear discriminant analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis) is a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-79)[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-80)
- [Fisher information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information), see also [scoring algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_algorithm) also known as Fisher's scoring, and [Minimum Fisher information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_Fisher_information), a variational principle which, when applied with the proper constraints needed to reproduce empirically known expectation values, determines the best probability distribution that characterizes the system.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-81)
- [F-distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-distribution), arises frequently as the null distribution of a [test statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_statistic), most notably in the analysis of variance
- [Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Tippett%E2%80%93Gnedenko_theorem) Fisher's contribution to this was made in 1927
- [Fisher–Tippett distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Tippett_distribution)
- [Von Mises–Fisher distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Mises%E2%80%93Fisher_distribution)[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-82)
- [Inverse probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_probability), a term Fisher used in 1922, referring to "the fundamental paradox of inverse probability" as the source of the confusion between statistical terms which refer to the true value to be estimated, with the actual value arrived at by estimation, which is subject to error.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-83)
- [Fisher's permutation test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics))
- [Fisher's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_inequality)[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-84)
- [Sufficient statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufficient_statistic), when a statistic is *sufficient* with respect to a [statistical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model) and its associated unknown parameter if "no other statistic that can be calculated from the same [sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)) provides any additional information as to the value of the parameter".[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-Fisher1922-85)
- [Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_noncentral_hypergeometric_distribution), a generalization of the [hypergeometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution), where sampling probabilities are modified by weight factors.
- [Student's *t*-distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution), widely used in statistics.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-Fisher_1925_90%E2%80%93104-86)[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-87)

## Recognition[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ronald_Fisher&action=edit&section=12)]

Fisher was elected to the [Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society) in 1929. He was made a [Knight Bachelor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Bachelor) by Queen [Elizabeth II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II) in 1952 and awarded the [Linnean Society of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnean_Society_of_London)  [Darwin–Wallace Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%E2%80%93Wallace_Medal) in 1958.

He won Copley Medal and the Royal Medal. He was an Invited Speaker of the [ICM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Congress_of_Mathematicians) in 1924 in Toronto and in 1928 in Bologna.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-88)

In 1950, [Maurice Wilkes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Wilkes) and [David Wheeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wheeler_(British_computer_scientist)) used the [Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Delay_Storage_Automatic_Calculator) to solve a [differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation) relating to gene frequencies in a paper by Ronald Fisher.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-89) This represents the first use of a computer for a problem in the field of biology. The [Kent distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_distribution) (also known as the Fisher–Bingham distribution) was named after him and [Christopher Bingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Bingham) in 1982 while [Fisher kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_kernel) was named after Fisher in 1998.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-90)

The [R. A. Fisher Lectureship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._A._Fisher_Lectureship) is a North American annual lecture prize, established in 1963. On 28 April 1998 a minor planet, [21451 Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21451_Fisher), was named after him.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-91)

In 2010, the R.A. Fisher Chair in Statistical Genetics was established in University College London to recognise Fisher's extraordinary contributions to both statistics and genetics.

[Anders Hald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hald) called Fisher "a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science",[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-Hald98-5) while [Richard Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins) named him "the greatest biologist since [Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin)":

> Not only was he the most original and constructive of the architects of the neo-Darwinian synthesis, Fisher also was the father of modern statistics and experimental design. He therefore could be said to have provided researchers in biology and medicine with their most important research tools, as well as with the modern version of biology's central theorem.> [> [92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-92)>

[Geoffrey Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Miller_(psychologist)) said of him:

> To biologists, he was an architect of the "modern synthesis" that used mathematical models to integrate Mendelian genetics with Darwin's selection theories. To psychologists, Fisher was the inventor of various statistical tests that are still supposed to be used whenever possible in psychology journals. To farmers, Fisher was the founder of experimental agricultural research, saving millions from starvation through rational crop breeding programs.> [> [93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#cite_note-Miller00-93)

Not only was he the most original and constructive of the architects of the neo-Darwinian synthesis. Fisher also was the father of modern statistics and experimental design. He therefore could be said to have provided researchers in biology and medicine with their most important research tools, as well as with the modern version of biology's central theorem."
