Description

Reactive programming with Observables can seem like a hard skill to learn. In this talk you will see Andre live code and explain the basics of RxJS Observables in a way that will demystify the concepts. We will build our own Observable from scratch, as well as our own basic operators, then see why RxJS can easily solve your async events problems.
