#### Welcome to The Hart Island Project.

Since 1980, 68,955 people have been buried in mass graves on Hart Island. The Traveling Cloud Museum is a collection of their stories.

Through this interactive map we invite you to explore the island with all its stories. By clicking on a plot number you can access records of individuals buried at that location. Each person has a clock measuring how long they have been buried on the island. You can stop their clock of anonymity and restore their history by adding a story to The Traveling Cloud Museum.

Plot numbers in red indicate that a person with AIDS has been identified at that location.
