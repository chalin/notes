 [ ##  Overview](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=dev-survey-2018-promotion#overview)

This year, over 100,000 developers told us how they learn, build their careers, which tools they’re using, and what they want in a job.

Each year, we ask the developer community about everything from their favorite technologies to their job preferences. This year marks the eighth year we’ve published our Annual Developer Survey results—with the largest number of respondents yet. Over 100,000 developers took the 30-minute survey this past January.

This year, we covered a few new topics ranging from artificial intelligence to ethics in coding. Here are a few of the top takeaways from this year’s results:

- DevOps and machine learning are important trends in the software industry today. Languages and frameworks associated with these kinds of works are on the rise, and developers working in these areas command the highest salaries.

- Only tiny fractions of developers say that they would write unethical code or that they have no obligation to consider the ethical implications of code, but beyond that, respondents see a lot of ethical gray. Developers are not sure how they would report ethical problems, and have differing ideas about who ultimately is responsible for unethical code.

- Developers are overall optimistic about the possibilities that artificial intelligence offers, but are not in agreement about what the dangers of AI are.

- Python has risen in the ranks of programming languages on our survey, surpassing C# in popularity this year, much like it surpassed PHP last year.

- When assessing a prospective job, different kinds of developers apply different sets of priorities. Women say their highest priorities are company culture and opportunities for professional development, while men say their highest priorities are compensation and working with specific technologies.

Want to dive into the results yourself? In a few weeks, we’ll make the anonymized results of the survey available for download under the [Open Database License (ODbL)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/). We look forward to seeing what you find!

Each month, about 50 million people visit Stack Overflow to learn, share, and build their careers. We estimate that 21 million of these people are professional developers and university-level students.

Our estimate of professional developers comes from the things people [read and do](https://kevinmontrose.com/2015/01/27/providence-machine-learning-at-stack-exchange/) when they visit Stack Overflow. We collect data on user activity to help surface jobs we think you might find interesting and questions we think you can answer. You can [download](https://stackoverflow.com/users/prediction-data) and clear this data at any time.

Many developers work on code outside of work. Over 80% of our respondents say that they code as a hobby. Other interests or responsibilities outside of software don't seem to reduce developers' interest in coding as a hobby. Those who said they are parents or have other caretaking responsibilities, those who exercise daily, or those who spend the most time outside were slightly *more* likely to code as a hobby than other groups.

Developers who work in different areas of software development have different average amounts of experience. DevOps specialists and developers who code for desktop and enterprise applications have the most experience. DevOps as a discipline and professional identity is relatively new, but the people working in this field are highly experienced. Game/graphics developers and mobile developers have the fewest years of experience.

Bootcamps are typically perceived as a way for newcomers to transition into a career as a software developer, but according to our survey, many participants in coding bootcamps were already working as developers. Almost half of our respondents who said they went to a coding bootcamp said they were already working as developers; these developers are likely updating their skills and moving to new areas of the tech industry. Of other bootcamp participants, the most common outcome is to find a job immediately or soon after graduating.

We find differences among developers by gender in our survey responses. For example, twice as many women than men have been coding two years or less. Also, developers who identify as transgender and non-binary contribute to open source at higher rates (58% and 60%, respectively) than developers who identify as men or women overall (45% and 33%.)

We see varying representation by men and women in different developer roles. All categories have dramatically more developers who identify as men than women but the ratio of men to women varies. Developers who are educators or academic researchers are about 10 times more likely to be men than women, while developers who are system admins or DevOps specialists are 25-30 times more likely to be men than women. Women have the highest representation as academics, QA developers, data scientists, and designers.

  68,577 responses; agreement on a 1-5 scale, from strongly disagree to strongly agree

We asked how much respondents agree or disagree with several statements about their place in the developer community. Overall 70% of developers agree or strongly agree that they feel a sense of connection with other developers. Developers are overall confident about their own skills compared to their peers, with only 18% agreeing or strongly agreeing that they are not as good at programming as their colleagues.

Developers' feelings on how much they belong and how they stack up to their peers change with how much experience they have. More experienced developers feel more connected, more confident, and less competitive. Notice that feeling less skilled drops quickly with experience while feeling less competitive drops more gradually and continues to drop into the second decade of coding experience.

This year we asked respondents if they have children or other dependents that they care for, and about a quarter of respondents say that they do. We asked in a free response question what these developers do for dependent care during work hours, and our respondents talked about options like school, their spouses/partners, and daycare.

The developers who said they do not have dependents to care for are younger on average than those who do. Over 30% of the developers without dependents are younger than 25, while only 5% of those with dependents are younger than 25. Almost 60% of developers with 10 or more years of professional coding experience have children or other dependents.

For the sixth year in a row, JavaScript is the most commonly used programming language. Python has risen in the ranks, surpassing C# this year, much like it surpassed PHP last year. Python has a solid claim to being the [fastest-growing major programming language](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/).

We see close alignment in the technology choices of professional developers and the developer population overall.

  % of developers who are not developing with the language or technology but have expressed interest in developing with it

For the third year in a row, Rust is the most loved programming language among our respondents, followed close behind by Kotlin, a language we asked about for the first time on our survey this year. This means that proportionally, more developers want to continue working with these than other languages.

Also for the third year in a row, Visual Basic 6 ranks as the most dreaded programming language. Most dreaded means that a high percentage of developers who are currently using the technology express no interest in continuing to do so.

Python is the most wanted language for the second year in a row, meaning that it is the language that developers who do not yet use it most often say they want to learn.

Technologies cluster together into related ecosystems that tend to be used by the same developers. In this chart we see a large central cluster for web development (with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) connected via SQL to one for Microsoft technologies (with C#, Visual Studio, and .NET Core). Along the left we see a constellation connecting Java, Android, and iOS across to Linux, bash/shell, and Python. Other smaller correlated clusters include Scala/Spark, C/C++, and other smaller technologies that include language-specific IDEs.

Some types of developers are involved in the increasing role of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the world today, so we asked developers what they think is dangerous and exciting about these technologies. There is not much consensus among developers about what is most dangerous; each answer was chosen roughly equally. The top choice for what is exciting about increasing AI is that jobs can be automated.

 [devtype_ratio-1.svg](../_resources/604c4490785019c966be92bf23d2ec9f.bin)

The concerns that developers bring to issues around artificial intelligence depend on the kind of coding work they do. For example, data scientists are 1.5 times more likely to consider issues around algorithmic fairness dangerous than any upcoming singularity when computers become more intelligent than people, the most of any kind of developer. We included a free response option on this question; there was not much serious worry about Skynet, but many developers discussed systemic bias being built into algorithmic decision making and the danger of AI being used without the ability to inspect and reason about decision pathways.

Software developers work in a diverse range of industries (so diverse that it's hard to ask about them all in one question!) both inside and outside the technology industry. Our answer choices focused on the tech industry this year, and of these choices, more professional developers work for companies doing web development, IT, and SaaS. Developers working in industries such as consulting and healthcare have more years of professional coding experience. Developers in these industries are twice as likely to have more than 20 years of experience than developers working in web development/design or eCommerce.

Developers tend to be more satisfied with their career than with their current job. Overall, career satisfaction does not vary significantly by industry. However, current job satisfaction is significantly lower for developers working in financial services and IT. Career satisfaction is highest for older developers, with ages of 50 or higher, and those with 20, 30, or more years of professional experience. Job satisfaction, by contrast, is highest for developers between 35 and 44 years old.

We included a free response opportunity after this question, and we saw thoughtful reflections from developers. These include responses about how the tools developers build are powerful and come with a lot of responsibility, situations where unethical outcomes may accidentally arise, and how large teams are involved in building software but developers can be the last line of defense against unethical code.

We asked developers what they find annoying, exhausting, interesting, and exciting about the process of searching for a new job in separate free response questions. Respondents said the positive aspects of searching for a new job include the new opportunities, technologies, and people that a new position can offer. On the other hand, they expressed frustration with broken processes around interviews and recruiting.

Engineering managers, DevOps specialists, and data scientists command the highest salaries. See our [Methodology](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#methodology) section for information on how we converted local currencies used by respondents to U.S. dollars.

Average top earners vary by geography. In India, for example, data scientists are among the top earners, while in European countries, back-end developers and developers working with embedded devices are among the top earners.

#### [Salary and Experience by Developer Type](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=dev-survey-2018-promotion#work-salary-and-experience-by-developer-type)

 [kinship-1.svg](../_resources/952b174ce72d8019a4b942a16bce519a.bin)

Naturally, developers with more years of experience are paid more. However, we also see that some type of coding work is paid more highly at the same level of experience. Data scientists and DevOps specialists are high earners for their level of experience.

#### [Salary and Experience by Language](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=dev-survey-2018-promotion#work-salary-and-experience-by-language)

 [positive_negative-1.svg](../_resources/85a67ec604a1fae2fbe4dacdf628cb9b.bin)

Developers using languages that appear above the line in this chart, such as Go, Clojure, and F#, are being paid more even given how much experience they have. Developers using languages below the line, like PHP and Visual Basic 6, however, are paid less even given years of experience. The size of the circles in this chart represents how many developers are using that language compared to the others.

In these free response questions, we asked developers first to describe the Stack Overflow community in general, and then what they would change about it. Developers were largely positive about Stack Overflow, focusing on the helpful nature of the community, and specifically had ideas about how questions, answers, comments, and reputation are handled. The treatment of new users and new people in our community were mentioned often as well.

#### [Developers' Perspectives About Our Community](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=dev-survey-2018-promotion#community-developers-perspectives-about-our-community)

 [salary_language-1.svg](../_resources/0c188c11b0385135c29bad1e802fed7f.bin)

This year, our survey included questions about what developers think the best, worst, most annoying, and most exciting things about Stack Overflow are. (These questions were randomized so that each respondent got one positive and one negative version.) In the positive versions of these questions, respondents were more likely to talk about the wealth of sharing and collaboration on our site. In the negative versions, respondents reflected on harsh interactions they've witnessed, downvotes, and handling of duplicate questions.

 [ ##  Methodology](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=dev-survey-2018-promotion#methodology)

How we planned and analyzed our survey

This report is based on a survey of 101,592 software developers from 183 countries around the world. This number of responses are what we consider “qualified” for analytical purposes based on completion and time spent on the survey; another approximately 20,000 responses were started but not included in the analysis because respondents did not answer enough questions. Of the qualified responses, 67,441 (66.4%) completed the entire survey.

###  Qualified Responses Worldwide

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Europe | 39,001 |
| North America | 25,016 |
| Asia | 24,700 |
| South America | 4,162 |
| Africa | 2,869 |
| Australia/Oceania | 2,591 |
| Other (country not listed) | 84  |

- The survey was fielded from January 8 to January 28.

- The median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was 25.8 minutes, and the median time for those who finished the entire survey was 29.4 minutes.

- Respondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top 5 sources of respondents were banner ads, email lists, house ads, blog posts, and Twitter. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the links for the survey and click to begin it. Respondents who finished the survey were awarded a “Census” badge as a motivation to complete the survey.

- We treated responses as qualified for analysis if the user spent a certain amount of time relative to how far they got into the survey. Most survey responses that spent less than 5 minutes were excluded from the final sample.

- We asked respondents about their salary. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked that respondent what their salary was in that currency, and whether that salary was weekly, monthly, or yearly.

    - For a short time on the first day, there was a bug that left out the last part of the question (weekly vs. monthly vs. yearly); those salary responses are not included here.

    - We converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on 2018-01-18, and also converted to annual salaries assuming 12 working months and 50 working weeks.

    - This question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 58,650 respondents (57.7% of qualified respondents) who gave us salary data.

    - The top approximately 1% of salaries inside and outside of the US were trimmed and replaced with threshold values. The threshold values for inside and outside the US were different.

- Many questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.

- The questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order. Also, the answers to most questions were randomized in order.

- Due to an error, Oracle and SQLite were excluded from the question about databases for the first day of the survey. We carefully examined whether the results for the other databases changed from the first day compared to the rest of the survey fielding period and they did not. The results shown here for database use and most loved/dreaded/wanted databases only use responses from after Oracle and SQLite were added to the possible answers.
