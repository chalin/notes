about datalab Youth audiences in particular are expecting the best content to be available to them in a single place, personalised to their preferences and interests. At the moment this is almost impossible for the BBC, since our content and audience data is distributed across myriad systems that are hard to connect. Additionally our content metadata is lacking, which makes it challenging to discover content. We are currently unable to properly engage the next generation of TV license fee payers, many of whom already have less affinity with the BBC than the rest of the UK population does.
