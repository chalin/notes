### Capture and inspect with Interceptor

Postman interceptor brings the power of your Chrome window to Postman! You can set custom headers (including cookies) from within Postman, and view cookies already set on the domain. You can also capture requests being sent from Chrome and import them into Postman. This makes building APIs a breeze!
