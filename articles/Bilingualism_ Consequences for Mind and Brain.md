## Cognitive networks in bilinguals

### Bilingual performance on conflict tasks

Early evidence that bilingual children solved nonverbal conflict tasks differently from monolingual children was reported in a study by Bialystok and Majumder [[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R21)]. Eight-year-old children were given a variety of nonverbal problems to solve, some of which contained perceptual distraction (block design from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) [[71](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R71)] and some which did not (Noelting's Juice Task [[72](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R72), [73](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R73)]). Bilingual children outperformed monolinguals on the conflict tasks, but children in the two groups were comparable on tasks that did not include distracting perceptual information. This pattern has been confirmed in studies of both children and adults using a flanker task (children: [[74](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R74), [75](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R75)]), theory of mind task (children: [[76](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R76), [77](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R77)]; adults: [[78](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R78)]), Simon task (children: [[79](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R79)]; adults: [[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R44)]). Other studies with adults have shown better performance by bilinguals in naming the font color in a Stroop task [[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R25)], smaller costs in task switching [[80](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R80)], better ability to maintain task set in an attention task [[81](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R81)], and more susceptibility to negative priming, presumably because of greater inhibition [[82](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R82)].

Some studies have extended these bilingual advantages into older age. Bialystok, Craik, Klein and Viswanathan [[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R44)] reported an experiment in which middle-aged and older adults who were either monolingual or bilingual were given a version of the Simon task. Participants were shown either a green or a red square on each trial, and the task was to press an associated response key as rapidly as possible. The keys were located at each side of the presentation screen. In one condition, the squares appeared centrally on the screen, so there was no spatial conflict between the location of stimuli and responses; in this condition there were no reaction-time (RT) differences between language groups. In a second condition, the colored squares appeared laterally on the screen, either directly above the appropriate response key (congruent condition) or on the other side of the screen, above the incorrect response key (incongruent condition). The RT difference between congruent and incongruent response trials (the Simon effect) is a measure of attentional control. Bilinguals produced smaller Simon effects than monolinguals at all ages.

Three other results from this study are noteworthy. First, the decrease in attentional control in older adults was reduced in the bilingual groups, suggesting that bilingualism may be protective against the effects of cognitive aging. Second, whereas a bilingual advantage was expected for incongruent stimuli, it was also found for congruent stimuli. This result has been replicated in subsequent studies [[43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R43)] and is difficult to account for in terms of response conflict or inhibition. Third, prolonged practice reduced both the Simon effect and the size of the bilingual advantage. Apparently all participants can learn to disregard the distracting effects of interfering stimuli given sufficient practice on a task, but it seems that bilinguals can learn this type of inhibition more rapidly. One interesting question in this regard is the extent to which this attenuation of attentional control is specific to the practiced situation, or whether it generalizes to tasks tapping attentional control in a different manner. Our conjecture is that the attenuation effect is context specific.

A complication that has emerged as more results are reported is that the bilingual advantage is not always found in samples of young adults. For example, a study examining performance on the Simon task in 5-year-olds, young, middle-aged and older adults found a bilingual advantage in RT in the 5-year-olds and in the older adults, but not in the young adult group [[83](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R83)]. Similarly, a study of the Stroop effect in younger and older adults found a bilingual advantage in both age groups but when the same participants performed the Simon arrow task the bilingual advantage was found only in the older adults [[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R25)]. Similarly, Salvatierra and Rosselli [[45](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R45)] used a simple version of the Simon task and reported a bilingual advantage for older but not younger adults. There is thus some evidence that the bilingual advantage is greatest in children and in older adults, but less constantly present in young adults – perhaps because the young adult group is at the developmentally peak age for cognitive control.

It appears that bilingual advantages for young adults tend to emerge on tasks or conditions that are difficult. For example, Bialystok [[84](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R84)] found that bilingual young adults outperformed their monolingual counterparts on the directional arrow Simon task, but only on the condition that included more monitoring and switching than a simpler condition. Similarly, several studies by Costa and colleagues have reported a bilingual advantage in young adults [[75](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R75), [85](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R85), [86](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R86)] but only under some conditions. For example, Costa et al. [[85](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R85)] demonstrated that the bilingual advantage on a flanker task held only under high monitoring conditions. In versions where most of the trials were of one type (congruent or incongruent) no bilingual advantage was observed; the advantage *was* found, however, in a condition involving 25% incongruent and 75% congruent trials, although even there the advantage decreased over blocks of the experiment (cf., [[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R44)]). Costa et al. [[85](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R85)] concluded that the bilingual advantage reflects a more efficient monitoring system for conflict resolution, in that bilinguals may be better at determining when the misleading information can be safely ignored. Finally, Hernández et al. [[86](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R86)] used a nonlinguistic version of the Stroop effect and found a trend towards both reduced interference and enhanced facilitation in young adult bilinguals compared with monolinguals (cf., older participants in [[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R25)]). One interesting aspect of the studies by Costa, Hernández and colleagues is that the monolinguals were Spanish speakers and the bilinguals’ two languages were Catalan and Spanish. Most of the participants were undergraduate students and were not immigrants, so the two groups were well equated apart from the language difference. In summary, the evidence for a bilingual advantage in younger adults is more sporadic than in other age groups, although at all ages there are some reports of studies showing no difference between monolinguals and bilinguals performing a conflict task.

### Neural correlates of cognitive reorganization

Recently, studies have begun to investigate the neural correlates of bilingual processing examined in the behavioral research. The majority of this research has used fMRI to study bilinguals performing a linguistic task in their two languages. Typically, participants name pictures or generate words in response to a cue signaling the required language and performance is compared for single language and mixed language conditions. Two early studies revealed promising results. The first led to the surprising finding that language switching was accompanied by activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), an area known to be part of the general executive control system [[28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R28)]. Less surprising was a study showing the involvement of Broca’s area as well as a left frontal area in a language switching task [[87](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R87)]. Subsequent research has corroborated the involvement of these systems and shown that language switching elicits a spatially-distributed activation pattern involving bilateral frontal regions, bilateral precentral areas, bilateral caudate, bilateral (or midline) pre-supplementary areas (pre-SMA), and bilateral temporal regions. This pattern has been found for German-French bilinguals [[88](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R88)], Spanish-Catalan bilinguals [[89](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R89)], Chinese-English bilinguals [[65](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R65), [90](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R90), [91](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R91)] and Spanish-English bilinguals [[92](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R92)]. A few studies [[65](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R65), [88](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R88)] have also reported activation in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but activation in this area is not consistently observed. Abutalebi and colleagues [[93](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R93)] extended this finding to show activation of ACC for both language switching and nonverbal switching. Importantly, these studies confirm that frontal systems involved in executive control are recruited by bilinguals to manage attention to language.

Abutalebi and Green [[94](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R94)] conducted a qualitative review of these studies and proposed that the ACC, left prefrontal cortex, left caudate and bilateral supramarginal gyri (SMG) constitute the neural correlates of the control mechanism for bilingual language production. This model was confirmed in a quantitative meta-analysis examining bilingual language switching [[95](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R95)] ([Figure 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/figure/F1/)). Both the qualitative and quantitative analyses point to multiple cortical regions in which functional activity is altered by bilingualism, but an outstanding question is whether activity in these regions is synchronous, forming a neural network that is responsive to bilinguals’ experience of managing two languages. To this end, a study by Nakamura and colleagues [[96](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R96)] showed strong connectivity between left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) in a group of Japanese-English bilinguals performing a cross-language priming task. The connectivity was stronger in the frontal-temporal coupling than in the reverse direction. This pattern was replicated using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with Japanese-English bilingual participants performing the same cross-language priming task. Nakamura and colleagues [[96](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R96)] interpreted the results as indicating top-down control from left IFG to left MTG in a bilingual context.

Bilingual influence on brain function and structure. Transparent brains showing the left and right hemispheres. Green voxels depict grey matter regions showing high activation during bilingual language switching in a meta-analysis ([94](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R94)). Red-yellow voxels  **...**

Taken together, fMRI research on bilingual language switching has implicated distributed cortical activation that converges in the frontal regions. Intriguingly, the brain regions related to bilingual switching are also critical for general attention and cognitive control [[97](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R97), [98](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R98)]. This overlap in brain regions activated for bilingual switching and cognitive control implies that the same mechanisms may be involved in both activities, and that these shared processes might help to explain the superior performance of bilinguals on nonverbal conflict tasks. In other words, using these cognitive control networks for bilingual language processing may reconfigure them for other purposes, providing part of the explanation for the behavioral differences between monolinguals and bilinguals found in nonverbal conflict tasks. Specifically, the evidence suggests that cognitive control networks may be more broadly based in bilinguals as a result of their dual function. However, fMRI studies on language switching in bilinguals can only show that these networks are *included* in bilingual language selection. Determining whether or not such reconfiguration occurs can only be evaluated by comparing monolinguals and bilinguals performing nonverbal conflict tasks. The hypothesis is that monolinguals and bilinguals will perform nonverbal control problems using somewhat different networks, specifically, that the network used by bilinguals will be more broadly based.

Only a few studies have contrasted the neural correlates of non-linguistic cognitive control in bilinguals and monolinguals. Garbin and colleagues [[99](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R99)] gave a color-shape switching task to Spanish monolingual and Spanish-Catalan bilingual young adults in fMRI. A bivalent stimulus (e.g., a red circle) and a cue (e.g., “color” or “shape”) were shown, and participants responded to the indicated dimension. Both RT of switch costs and accuracy favored the bilingual participants but activation patterns were also different for the two groups: monolinguals showed increased activation in the right IFG, whereas bilinguals showed increased activation in left inferior frontal gyrus. More interestingly, higher levels of activation in left IFG and left striatum were associated with smaller switch costs for the bilingual participants, but increased activation in the right IFG was associated with larger switch costs. In light of the lack of switching effect in the behavioral data, it is possible that the bilinguals relied more on the left IFG and striatum in face of the demand to switch between responses associated with a bivalent stimulus. The left IFG was identified in both the qualitative [[94](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R94)] and quantitative [[95](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R95)] meta-analyses of bilingual language switching. This region is central to speech production [[100](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R100)] and has been shown to have higher activation for bilinguals than monolinguals during speech production [[101](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R101), [102](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R102)]. Thus, left IFG appears to be one of the overlapping brain regions in bilinguals handling both language switching and non-linguistic cognitive control.

A study by Luk and colleagues [[103](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R103)] used an adaptation of a flanker task to compare activation in monolingual and bilingual participants. The stimuli consisted of a string of five chevrons, and the task was to indicate the direction of the red one (that could appear in one of three positions) while ignoring the four black ones. In a previous behavioral study with these stimuli, bilinguals performed this task more rapidly than monolinguals [[104](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R104)]. The fMRI data were analyzed using a multivariate statistical technique for neuroimaging data (Partial Least Squares; for review, see [[105](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R105)]) to identify integrated neural networks. The results showed that monolinguals and bilinguals recruited different neural networks for both congruent and incongruent trials. Another condition that tested ‘no-go’ responses indicated no difference between groups. Importantly, greater activity in the bilingual network, including areas identified in the meta-analysis [[95](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R95)], was related to smaller RT costs for incongruent trials. There are two implications of these results. First, bilingualism alters functional neural network at the response-selection level (congruent and incongruent trials), but not at the motor execution level (response inhibition no-go trials), a pattern consistent with previous results for both adults [[106](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R106)] and children [[79](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R79),[107](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R107)]. Second, bilinguals showed a brain-behavior correlation when suppressing interference from conflicting flankers, replicating a previous study using magnetoencephalography (MEG) [[108](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R108)].

Although bilingualism is a language experience, managing attention to two languages imposes demands on the cognitive system that require brain regions not typically used for language processing. From studies of bilingual language switching and non-linguistic cognitive control, and from the meta-analysis cited earlier, it seems likely that the neural locus of cognitive control in bilinguals lies in bilateral frontal regions. In order to facilitate information transfer between the hemispheres, it is also possible that prolonged bilingual experience alters anatomical structures in addition to cortical functional networks. Cortical activity assessed by fMRI is limited to blood-oxygenated-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the grey matter. However, when investigating domain-general neural changes (cognitive control) in response to domain-specific experience (bilingualism), it is important to use methods that allow not only the identification of functional networks but also their underlying anatomical structures [[109](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R109), [110](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R110)].

There is some evidence for the plasticity of cortical grey matter in response to bilingualism. Mechelli and colleagues [[111](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R111)] reported higher grey matter density in left inferior parietal regions in a group of Italian-English bilinguals relative to English monolinguals. Strikingly, proficiency in English, the second language, correlated positively with grey matter density in this region. A recent study has extended brain plasticity to white matter. Luk, Bialystok, Craik and Grady [[112](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R112)] ([Figure 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/figure/F1/)) used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure resting-state functional connectivity in monolingual and bilingual older adults. The results showed higher white matter integrity in bilingual older adults, primarily in the corpus callosum connecting the two hemispheres but also extending to bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi, right inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus. Identifying a seed close to the white matter voxels showing a group difference, Luk et al. conducted a resting-state functional connectivity analysis and showed that while both monolinguals and bilinguals had correlating brain activity with contralateral regions at rest, bilinguals had increased anterior-posterior connectivity. This evidence suggests that bilingualism is associated with better maintenance of white matter structures in the course of normal aging [[113](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R113)]. Similar DTI results have also been recently reported in bilingual children around the left inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus [[114](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R114)].

### Nature of the bilingual advantage

Why might bilingualism be associated with an advantage in attentional control? The need to manage two jointly activated languages apparently leads to an enhancement of frontal-posterior attentional control mechanisms with the consequence that other types of cognitive control are also enhanced. Inhibitory control was suggested as the relevant mechanism in early studies [[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R44), [61](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R61)] and continues to be endorsed by some researchers [[51](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R51), [115](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R115)]. One problem with this account, however, is the recurrent finding of a bilingual advantage in congruent trials (for which there is no conflict) as well as incongruent trials [[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R44), [75](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R75)]. Minimally, therefore, inhibition alone is insufficient to explain bilingual processing differences. The inhibition view is also challenged by evidence from preverbal infants who demonstrate early effects of bilingualism but for whom language inhibition is not a plausible explanation ([Box 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#BX1)).

### Box 1: Bilingualism in infancy

Research with infants being raised in bilingual homes has produced dramatic evidence for very early effects of bilingualism and challenges some standard explanations for the mechanism underlying these effects. It has long been known that children being raised with two languages do not confuse the languages when learning to speak, even though they may borrow from one when speaking the other [[131](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R131)]. It is also well known that monolingual infants lose the ability to make phonetic discriminations not present in their language by about 10-months old whereas bilingual infants continue to distinguish between phonetic categories relevant to all languages. Thus, it is not surprising that bilingual infants can differentiate between their two languages essentially from birth [[132](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R132)]. What is surprising, however, is the extension of this discrimination to non-acoustic properties of language. Weikum and colleagues [[133](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R133)] showed silent video clips to 8-month old infants who were being raised in homes that were either monolingual English or English-French bilingual. Using a habituation paradigm, the speaker switched languages after habituation and the researchers measured whether or not infants regained interest. The results showed renewed attention among the bilingual but not the monolingual infants. To determine whether the bilingual infants had learned about the facial structures that accompany each language or something more general, the same materials were presented to monolingual Spanish (or Catalan) infants and bilingual Spanish-Catalan infants [[134](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R134)]. Again, only the bilingual infants noticed the change in language, even though the children in this study had no experience with either language. The authors concluded that bilingualism enhances general perceptual attentiveness through the experience of attending to two sets of visual cues.

This enhanced perceptual attentiveness may help explain the results of a study in which 7-month old monolingual and bilingual infants learned a head-turn response to a cue to obtain a visual reward and then had to replace that with a competing response for the same reward [[135](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R135)]. Again, only the bilingual infants could learn the new response. Even before children have productive language ability, the experience of building two distinct representational systems endows them with greater perceptual and attentional resources than their monolingual peers. In light of such evidence for bilingual advantages in the first year of life, explanations for the mechanism responsible for the advantages found later may need to be reconsidered to include a role for such perceptual processes.

An alternative to inhibition is to consider the demands imposed by a mixed set of congruent and incongruent trials: there is always some probability that the next display *may* be an incongruent trial. Thus, even on congruent trials the display must be evaluated before the participant commits to a response. Congruent responses will typically be faster than incongruent responses, but individuals with superior attentional control processes (e.g., bilinguals) will be able to carry out such evaluative decisions more rapidly and effectively. Therefore, a different account of the bilingual advantage is in terms of conflict monitoring [[43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R43), [85](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R85), [86](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R86)]. Evidence supporting this view comes from situations in which monitoring demands are low – if the majority of trials are of one type only [[84](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R84), [85](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R85)], the potentially misleading information (spatial position in the Simon task, flanker items in the flanker paradigm) can be treated as a valid cue, even if the participant must respond in the direction opposite to that indicated by the cue. In such low-monitoring conditions the bilingual advantage is typically not found. More generally, Hernández, Costa, and Humphreys [[116](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R116)] argue for a bilingual advantage in the deployment of attention, enabling them to resist “capture” by irrelevant information; such differences in attentional control may be the consequence of superior conflict monitoring. Conflict monitoring and inhibition are not mutually exclusive: Although monitoring is consistent with evidence that pure blocks of congruent trials are performed equivalently by monolinguals and bilinguals [[106](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R106), [117](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R117)], an inhibition account is still required to explain evidence that pure blocks of incongruent trials are sometimes performed faster by bilinguals, notably by older adults for whom the task is more effortful [[106](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R106)].

Another problem with a pure inhibition account is that bilingual advantages are only found with some types of inhibition. The relevant distinction is captured by the contrast between the concepts of *response inhibition* and *interference suppression* [[79](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R79), [118](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R118)]. In response inhibition, a univalent stimulus is associated with a prepotent response that must be overruled, such as say “day” to a picture of night or press “left” when the arrow points right. Bilinguals typically show no advantage in these situations [[79](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R79), [107](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R107)]. In interference suppression, a bivalent stimulus contains two cues, each associated with a different response, such as the word “red” written in blue ink, so attention must be selectively focused on the relevant cue. Bilinguals typically outperform monolinguals on these tasks [[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R25)]. The hallmark of univalent response inhibition tasks is that the correct response can be pre-programmed before the cuing stimulus appears (e.g., if sun appears I’ll say ‘night;’ if the arrow points right I’ll respond left). On bivalent tasks, in contrast, the nature of the interfering information is not revealed until the display appears; for example, in the Simon task the participant prepares to respond on the left if the stimulus is green, but cannot prepare to deal with possible competing information until the display is shown. Bilinguals are more efficient at dealing with this online interference, in much the same way as the picture of a horse presented to a French/English bilingual would evoke both ‘*horse*’ and ‘*cheval*’, one of which must be suppressed. In a sense, the bilingual must constantly maintain the set of ‘respond in one language, suppress the other language’ whenever the possibility of two languages exists (cf., global inhibition). Further, this set maintenance must coexist with processing the stimuli and responses of the language currently utilized in a fluent and appropriate manner (cf., local inhibition). Thus, language use for bilinguals involves interference suppression, and the online monitoring required in both nonverbal task switching and language selection is similar.

The suggestion that bilinguals are particularly adept at maintaining the appropriate one of two (or more) relevant task goals or attentional sets in working memory has much in common with the notion of *selection* of wanted stimuli as opposed to *inhibition* of unwanted ones. The net effect is the same, but by this view the suppression of potentially interfering information is essentially a *consequence* of active selection of the relevant information, rather than a primary mechanism of direct inhibition. This view is consistent with that proposed by Colzato and colleagues [[81](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R81)] who concluded that the bilingual advantage is not due to the constant exercise of inhibition, but that learning to keep two languages separate leads to an improvement in selecting goal-relevant information from goal-irrelevant information.

The sum of the evidence places the bilingual advantage beyond the explanatory power of a single process, a simple neural network, or a single executive control component. Instead, the ongoing experience of monitoring two languages, in conjunction with the need to monitor context, speaker, and other environmental cues while inhibiting attention to the currently unused but active language modifies how the mind and brain engage in ordinary conversation for bilinguals. The more effortful any of these components become, the more likely it is for bilingual advantages to emerge on nonverbal tasks. However, the impact of this modification may be seen most clearly on tasks that bear the closest resemblance to bilingual language use, such as task switching. In this case, it is easy to see how the task of attending to the shape of a stimulus instead of its color resembles the task of retrieving the name for an object in French instead of in English. Not surprisingly, these tasks are typically performed better by bilinguals than by monolinguals, although the details of those performances are not yet well understood: Some studies report bilingual advantages on mixing costs indicating set shifting [[86](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R86), [106](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R106)] while others report the advantage in local switch costs indicating response switching [[80](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R80),[119](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R119)]. More generally, it is important to point out that bilingual advantages are not always found, even on tasks for which such performance differences would be expected. Some of the conditions that support the appearance of a bilingual advantage have been discussed, such as the need for monitoring and difficulty of the conditions, but others are still unknown. Another factor in determining performance outcomes is likely the nature or degree of bilingualism in the participants ([Box 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#BX2)). More details about the specific tasks and precise language histories of the bilingual participants may resolve these differences.

### Box 2: How bilingual?

Bilingualism is not a categorical experience but experimental research designs require it is treated as such – participants are monolingual or bilingual and differences in performance are assessed for members of the two groups. However, individuals can never be perfectly monolingual or bilingual: even the most monolingual people have had some experience with another language, for example as a school subject or a travel necessity, and all bilinguals have preferred languages or preferred contexts for each. These gradations raise three questions about the research results.

The first question is the possibility of a cumulative benefit for multiple languages. If managing two languages enhances cognitive control processes, then does further enhancement accrue from the management of three or more languages, as explicitly proposed by Diamond [[136](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R136)]? Research by Chertkow et al. [[123](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R123)] on Alzheimer’s disease and Kavé et al. [[127](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R127)] on normal aging showed better outcomes for multilinguals than for bilinguals, but there may be significant differences between multilinguals and bilinguals that do not exist between bilinguals and monolinguals. As we have suggested, bilinguals are typically not pre-selected for talent or interest but multilinguals may often be individuals with high ability and motivation to learn other languages, factors which may impact as well on cognitive performance.

The second question is the degree of bilingualism required for these benefits to emerge. If bilingualism is protective against some forms of dementia, then middle-aged people will want to know whether it is too late to learn another language, or whether their high-school French will count towards cognitive reserve. A related question concerns the age of acquisition of a second language; is earlier better? The best answer at present is that early age of acquisition, overall fluency, frequency of use, levels of literacy and grammatical accuracy all contribute to the bilingual advantage, with no single factor being decisive [[137](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R137), [138](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R138)]. Increasing bilingualism leads to increasing modification of cognitive outcomes.

Finally, if the benefits of bilingualism are at least partly explained by the joint activation of two languages, does the similarity of the two languages matter? Does Spanish-English bilingualism require more (or less?) attentional control to maintain separation than say Chinese-English bilingualism? In a study with children who spoke English plus one of French, Spanish, or Chinese, there was no effect of the type of bilingualism, and all bilingual children outperformed monolingual children on tests of executive control [[139](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322418/#R139)].
