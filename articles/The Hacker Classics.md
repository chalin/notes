The Hacker Classics

Hacker News is no different from most of today's web in emphasizing what's new. When you're following a bunch of feeds, it's easy to forget that the web is the greatest library in the history of the worldâ€”and that a good library doesn't just have a rack of newspapers, it has a vast collection of books and archives: the stacks.

Here, then, are the stories that occasionally surface on news.yc when someone goes diving into the stacks. It includes every HN post with a date like "(1999)" in its title that has earned more than 40 votes. You can see how this page is built [on Github](https://github.com/jsomers/hacker-classics).
