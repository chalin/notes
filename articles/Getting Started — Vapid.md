Getting Started Vapid is software that helps you build simple websites. It’s akin to other content management systems (CMS), like WordPress and Squarespace , in that it has two components: a public-facing website, and a private dashboard for editing content. The gist of Vapid is: It does most of what you need, but probably not everything. You only need to know HTML (plus CSS and JS to the extent that your design calls for it). You should be able to learn the basics in a few minutes. Content and files that you’ve created here should be portable to your next platform.
