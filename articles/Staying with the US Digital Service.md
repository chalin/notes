Staying with the US Digital Service

# Staying with the US Digital Service

Posted January 18, 2017  in [Personal](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/type/personal/)

A few months ago, I took a leave of absence from Google to do a stint with the [US Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov/mission). A lot of people know about the US Digital Service because they [helped rescue the healthcare.gov website](https://www.fastcompany.com/3046756/obama-and-his-geeks). But you might not realize that the US Digital Service has helped [veterans get their health benefits](https://www.usds.gov/report-to-congress/2016/vets-dot-gov/), brought [bug bounties to the federal government](https://www.usds.gov/report-to-congress/2016/hack-the-pentagon/), and helped [the IRS protect taxpayer info](https://www.usds.gov/report-to-congress/2016/irs-secure-access/).

When I joined the US Digital Service, I only planned to stay for three months. That quickly turned into six months after I saw the impact of the USDS. In the last month, I made a big decision. On December 31, 2016, I resigned from Google. I’m currently serving as [director of engineering for the USDS](https://backchannel.com/the-final-days-of-obamas-tech-surge-864b9bf60d34#.vmjdwbyux). Mikey Dickerson, the first administrator of the USDS, is a political appointee, so he’ll step down on Inauguration Day. When that happens, I’ll serve as acting administrator of the USDS. The work that the USDS does is critical to the American people, and I’m honored to continue that tradition.

If you’re reading this blog post, odds are that you might be a tech geek yourself. I’d like to ask you to review what the US Digital Service has [accomplished in just a few years](https://www.usds.gov/report-to-congress/2016/). If you’re a more visual person, you might enjoy this short video:

Working for the government doesn’t pay as well as a big company in Silicon Valley. We don’t get any free lunches. Many days are incredibly frustrating. All I can tell you is that the work is deeply important and inspiring, and you have a chance to work on things that genuinely make peoples’ lives better. A friend who started working in this space several years ago told me “These last five years have been the hardest and worst and best and most rewarding I think I will ever have.”

If you have experience in the tech industry, there’s a decent chance that you have skills that can benefit the American people. If you’re considering joining the US Digital Service, [please fill out an application](https://www.usds.gov/join).
