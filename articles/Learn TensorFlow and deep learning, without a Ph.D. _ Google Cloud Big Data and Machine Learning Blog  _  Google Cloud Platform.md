**This 3-hour course (video + slides) offers developers a quick introduction to deep-learning fundamentals, with some TensorFlow thrown into the bargain. **

[Deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) (aka neural networks) is a popular approach to building machine-learning models that is [capturing developer imagination](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513696/deep-learning/). If you want to acquire deep-learning skills but lack the time, I feel your pain.

In university, I had a math teacher who would yell at me, “Mr. Görner, integrals are taught in kindergarten!” I get the same feeling today, when I read most free online resources dedicated to deep learning. My kindergarten education was apparently severely lacking in “dropout lullabies,” “cross-entropy riddles,” and [“relu-gru-rnn-lstm](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) monster stories.” Yet, these fundamental concepts are taken for granted by many, if not most, authors of online educational resources about deep learning.

To help more developers embrace deep-learning techniques, without the need to earn a Ph.D., I have attempted to flatten the learning curve by building a short crash-course (3 hours total). The course is focused on a few basic network architectures, including dense, convolutional and recurrent networks, and training techniques such as dropout or batch normalization. (This course was initially presented at the [Devoxx conference](https://devoxx.be/) in Antwerp, Belgium, in November 2016.) By watching the recordings of the course and viewing the annotated slides, you can learn how to solve a couple of typical problems with neural networks and also pick up enough vocabulary and concepts to continue your deep learning self-education — for example, by exploring [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) resources. (TensorFlow is Google’s internally developed framework for deep learning, which has been growing in popularity since it was released as open source in 2015.)

### Dive into the presentations

**If you have 1 hour**: watch [this presentation](https://youtu.be/qyvlt7kiQoI) while following the [slide deck](https://goo.gl/pHeXe7). This installment covers dense and convolutional networks and is also available as a [self-paced codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-tensorflow-mnist)

**If you have 3 hours (recommended; recurrent networks are worth it!)**: watch [this presentation](https://youtu.be/vq2nnJ4g6N0). You'll need both slide decks, [Part 1](https://goo.gl/pHeXe7)[(L)](https://goo.gl/pHeXe7)and [Part 2](https://goo.gl/jrd7AR).
