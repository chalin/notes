Minimal character-based LSTM implementation June 07, 2018 at 05:34 Tags Math , Machine Learning Following up on the earlier post deciphering a minimal vanilla RNN implementation, here I'd like to extend the example to a simple LSTM model. Once again, the idea is to combine a well-commented code sample ( available here ) with some high-level diagrams and math to enable someone to fully understand the code. The LSTM architecture presented herein is the standard one originating from Hochreiter's and Schmidthuber's
