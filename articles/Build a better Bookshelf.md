Build a better Bookshelf I happen to use OneNote a lot recently, mainly for storing my handwritten notes thanks to the pretty accurate OCR feature. Then I realize, there's also a great usage of OCR in OneNote other than just saving notes, it's: building an electronic index for all of your physical book . How? Step 1: Install any document scanning app on your phone Step 2: Scan all the index pages and table of contents in all of your books Step 3: Send it to whatever software you're using that has OCR feature
