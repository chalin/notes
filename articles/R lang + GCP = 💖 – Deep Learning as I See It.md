Recently we have released a new revision of AI Platform Notebooks and Deep Learning VMs, M26. Many changes are part of the release, however the main one is [R](https://blog.kovalevskyi.com/r-lang-gcp-5f1b76e5c6afabout:invalid#zSoyz)! Yes, we do have the support of R language now, as a first-class citizen on the [Google Cloud AI Platform Notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-notebooks/) as well as it is now a flavor of Deep Learning VMs.

> BTW if you do not know what is Deep Learning VM, read > [> this](https://blog.kovalevskyi.com/deep-learning-images-for-google-cloud-engine-the-definitive-guide-bc74f5fb02bc)>  first

### What Is Under The¬†Hood

New flavor effectively is the same familiar interface of the [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with pre-configure [R-lang kernel](https://irkernel.github.io/) and tons of other additional things. Among extra things:

- ‚Ä¢r-essentials
- ‚Ä¢rpy2 (that allows you to use both Python and R in the same notebook!!!)
- ‚Ä¢h2o
- ‚Ä¢xgboost
- ‚Ä¢Google Cloud clients, such as: cloudml; bigrquery; googleCloudStorageR; googleComputeEngineR; googleAuthR; googleAnalyticsR

BTW if you prefer more to pay tons of money for almost the same thing, you can look on the R-studio offering on the [Cloud Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/rstudio-launcher-public/rstudio-server-pro-for-gcp) (~2k$ per month!).

### How To Use¬†It

#### Via AI Platform Notebooks

Using R with Notebook is a straightforward process, R is now an officially supported ‚Äúflavor‚Äù, so just:

- ‚Ä¢go to the console: https://console.cloud.google.com/mlengine/notebooks/instances
- ‚Ä¢press ‚Äúcreate instance‚Äù and
- ‚Ä¢pick R:)

As you probably have spotted already, there is no GPU support for R just yet. One can attach GPU to it later on, but currently, such configuration is not supported just yet.

#### Via DLVMs

If you want to use R with DLVMs, it is straightforward you need to execute one command:
