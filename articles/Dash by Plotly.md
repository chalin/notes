# Dash is Productive

Productive

Before Dash, it would take an entire team of engineers and designers to create interative analtyics apps.

Completely Customizable

Every aesthetic element of a Dash app is customizable and rendered in the web so you can employ the full power of CSS.

Lightweight

Dash apps require very little boilerplate to get started. A fully-functional analytics app can weigh in at just 40 lines of Python or R code.

Direct Control

Dash links interactive UI controls and displays, like sliders, dropdown menus, and graphs, to your data analytics code, giving you hands-on input for your data views.

Dash In Action

# Oil and Gas Dashboard

This Dash app displays oil production in western New York. Filters at the top of the app update the graphs below. Selecting or hovering over data in one plot will update the other plots ('cross-filtering').

Dash apps are powered by Plotly.js, a fully featured charting library including maps like these, financial charts, scientific graphs, and more.
