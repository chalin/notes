The Glass Room by Mozilla & TTC

## 69 – 71 Charing Cross Road, London

25th October – 12th November

The Glass Room is a disruptive tech store with nothing for sale. Instead, it challenges you to reconsider the technologies you use every day, how much they reveal about you, and what choices you can make in our quantified society.
