[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/products/) (GCP) has been growing rapidly as Google invests heavily in it development. Sadly, the Wikipedia entry for GCP is garbage, and it’s difficult to skim the blog as a timeline. For my own sake, I wrote this attempt at an objective timeline of significant events and launches for GCP.
