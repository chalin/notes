# Our Online Guided Reading Tool for Improving Vocabulary, Fluency, Comprehension, and Prosody

Oral reading is critical in improving reading fluency, comprehension, and prosody. Reading Assistant Plus is an innovative online guided reading tool that provides intensive reading practice. Learners use the tool to read developmentally appropriate texts both silently and aloud. What makes Reading Assistant Plus such an innovative reading practice tool is its use of patented technology that listens as each word is read aloud and delivers immediate support whenever a learner struggles with or mispronounces a word — reinforcing newly learned reading skills, vocabulary, and fluency.

# What Reading Assistant Plus Does

**Provides Guided Reading Support to More Students**

- Reading Assistant Plus uses patented speech recognition technology to deliver real-time corrective guided reading feedback, enabling learners to self-correct as they are reading aloud.

**Improves Both Silent Reading and Oral Reading Skills**

- Unlike other digital reading practice resources that only allow learners to record themselves reading aloud, Reading Assistant Plus actually listens and helps learners whenever they struggle or mispronounce a word — it's like having a personal guided reading tutor available 24/7!

**Saves Teachers Time**

- Automatic calculation of words correct per minute (WCPM), and actionable comprehension and vocabulary reports make it easy for teachers to track learners’ reading levels, and specific areas of strength and weakness.

**Pre-teaches Academic Vocabulary**

- Built-in Word Wall activities pre-teach academic vocabulary, activate prior knowledge, and provide pronunciations for new words before learners begin each e-book passage.

**Reaches the Reluctant Reader**

- Reading Assistant Plus provides reading selections for a variety of interests and reading levels, plus frequent comprehension checks, to keep learners motivated and focused on reading for meaning.
