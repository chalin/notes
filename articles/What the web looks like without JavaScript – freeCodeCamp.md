Google Maps when you turn off JavaScript

A Berlin-based web developer — who codes JavaScript for a living — decided to go an entire day without JavaScript.

Let’s face it — in an insane world where the average webpage is 2.4 megabytes — [the same size as the 1993 game Doom](https://fcc.im/2rClKqV) — turning off JavaScript completely can seem like a sane thing to do.

Well, here are her main observations after disabling JavaScript in the browser for a day:

- •The web is really fast without JavaScript
- •There aren’t any ads. No auto-playing videos or “tell us your email address” pop-ups.
- •But… a lot of websites don’t work at all. Images don’t load, and forms can’t be submitted.

Here’s what several popular websites she visited looked like with JavaScript disabled:

**YouTube**’s videos and thumbnails don’t load.

**Netflix** doesn’t load anything except for its logo in the upper left hand corner.

**Amazon** looks a bit odd, but it still works.

**Wikipedia** still works great.
