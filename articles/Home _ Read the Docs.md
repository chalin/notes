# Read the Docs

Create, host, and browse documentation.

## Technical documentation lives here

Read the Docs simplifies software documentation by automating building, versioning, and hosting of your docs for you.

### Free docs hosting

We will host your documentation for free forever. There are no tricks. We help 84,074 open source projects share their docs.

### Webhooks

Whenever you push code to your favorite version control system, whether that is Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, or Subversion, we will automatically build your docs so your code and documentation are never out of sync.

### Multiple formats

Of course we build and host your docs for the web, but they are also vieweable as PDFs, as single page HTML, and for eReaders. No additional configuration is required.

### Multiple versions

We can host and build multiple versions of your docs so having a 1.0 version of your docs and a 2.0 version of your docs is as easy as having a separate branch or tag in your version control system.

## Read the Docs is funded by the community

Read the Docs is a huge resource that millions of developers rely on for software documentation. It would not be possible without the support of our [sponsors](https://readthedocs.org/sustainability/), [advertisers](https://readthedocs.org/sustainability/advertising/), and [readers like you](https://readthedocs.org/accounts/gold/).

Read the Docs is **community supported**. It depends on users like you to contribute to development, support, and operations. You can learn more about how to [contribute](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute.html) in our docs. Thanks so much to our wonderful [community team](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/team.html) who helps us run the site. Read the Docs wouldn't be possible without them.

Hosting for the project is graciously provided by [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/).
