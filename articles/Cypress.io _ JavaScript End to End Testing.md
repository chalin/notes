## A complete end-to-end testing experience.

### Install the Cypress Test Runner and write tests locally.

#### Set up tests

[Installing Cypress](https://on.cypress.io/installing-cypress) is simple. No dependencies, extra downloads, or changes to your code required.

#### Write tests

[Write tests](https://on.cypress.io/writing-your-first-test) easily and quickly, and watch them execute in real time as you build your web application.

### Build up a suite of tests and record them in CI.

#### Run tests

With our [Dashboard Service](https://www.cypress.io/dashboard/), debugging your tests in CI is as easy as running tests locally.

#### Record tests

Cypress records CI test data, screenshots and video, which your team can view in your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.cypress.io/).

## Test your code, not your patience.

Cypress is the new standard in front-end testing that every developer and QA engineer needs.

### Developer-friendly

Cypress has been made specifically for [developers and QA engineers](https://www.cypress.io/how-it-works/), to help them get more done.

### Open source

Cypress benefits from our amazing [open source community](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) - and it is evolving better and faster than if we worked on it alone.

### Built from the ground up

Cypress is based on a [completely new architecture](https://www.cypress.io/how-it-works/). No more Selenium. Lots more power.

## What sets Cypress apart?

### Time travel

Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run. Simply hover over commands in the [Command Log](https://on.cypress.io/overview-of-the-gui#Command-Log) to see exactly what happened at each step.

### Debuggability

Stop guessing why your tests are failing. [Debug](https://on.cypress.io/debugging) directly from familiar tools like Chrome DevTools. Our readable errors and stack traces make debugging lightning fast.

### Real time reloads

Cypress automatically reloads whenever you make changes to your tests. See commands execute in real time in your app.

### Automatic waiting

Never add waits or sleeps to your tests. Cypress automatically [waits for commands and assertions](https://on.cypress.io/introduction-to-cypress#Cypress-is-Not-Like-jQuery) before moving on. No more async hell.
