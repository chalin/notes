## A Standard Library for Microservices

[StdLib is a Standard Library for Microservices](https://stdlib.com/)

Use StdLib to build production-ready, auto-scaled, "server-less" microservices in *minutes*.

StdLib has three components:
1. A central registry for microservices
2. A distribution platform for hosting at scale
3. A development framework for package management and service creation

It is the *fastest, easiest* way to begin building microservices on your own or with a team, and currently supports Node.js 6.5.0. The distribution and hosting platform for execution of your services is built atop AWS Lambda ensuring both the scale and reliability you would expect for production-ready services.

You can view publicly available services [on the StdLib search page](https://stdlib.com/search).
