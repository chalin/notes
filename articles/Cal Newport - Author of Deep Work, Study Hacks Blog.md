## WHAT **THEY SAY**

"I challenge you not to devour this wonderful book in one sitting."

**-Greg McKeown, author of *Essentialism***

“What a timely and useful book! It's neither hysterical nor complacent - a workable guide to being thoughtful about digital media. It's already made me rethink some of my media use in a considered way.”

**- Naomi Alderman, author of *The Power***

"This book is an urgent call to action for anyone serious about being in command of their own life."

**- Ryan Holiday, author of *The Obstacle Is the Way***

"You’re not the user, you’re the product. Hang up, log off, and tune in to a different way to be in the world. Bravo, Cal. Smart advice for good people."

**- Seth Godin, author of *This Is Marketing***

“Newport is making a bid to be the Marie Kondo of technology: someone with an actual plan for helping you realize the digital pursuits that do, and don’t, bring value to your life.”

**- Ezra Klein, founder of Vox.com**
