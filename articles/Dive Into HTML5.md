Dive Into HTML5 elaborates on a hand-picked selection of features from the [HTML5](http://www.whatwg.org/html5) specification and other fine standards. We encourage you to [buy the printed work](https://www.amazon.com/HTML5-Up-Running-Mark-Pilgrim/dp/0596806027) — Mark Pilgrim’s artfully titled “HTML5: Up *&* Running” — published on paper by O’Reilly, under the Google Press imprint.

This particular edition of Dive Into HTML5 is advanced by [the diveintomark team](https://github.com/diveintomark?tab=members). We work hard to add and update content, links, APIs, and actively maintain this fine resource; refreshing and reflecting the relevant and current state of HTML5, just as Mark Pilgrim did during his tenure. We attribute this work in the manner specified by Mark, and we make modifications to the site's content. We do not in any way suggest that he endorses us or our use of his work. We hope you do.
