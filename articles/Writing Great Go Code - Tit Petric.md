Writing Great Go Code After writing two books on the subject ( API Foundations in Go and 12 Factor Applications with Docker and Go ) and years of writing various Go microservices, I do want to put some thoughts down as to what it takes to write great Go code. But first of all, let me explain this very plainly to all you who are reading this. Writing great code is subjective. You might have completely different ideas as to what is considered great code, and we might only agree on some points. On the other hand, neither of us may be wrong in such a case, weâ€™re just coming from two different perspective viewpoints, and may have chosen to solve our engineering problems in a different way.
