Thomas Moore  | Guys, I don't care if the guitar is out of tune! He sounds good, and I played along with him. Kids these days are so entitled.

Emily Lorraine  | I remember when I told my friend about Lindsay buckingham and Stevie nicks and she goes " wait so he is good right" and in like "UH YEAH LINDSAY IS THE BEST!" And she was like " no I'm talking about Stevie!" And then I'm like " Stevie is a girl...l and then she goes " STEVIE IS A GIRL AND LINDSAY IS A GUY!? THEY SHOULD SWITCH NAMES!!" And still to this day I laugh at that story ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Carol Dansereau  | Yep. The guitar is a little out of tune- but who cares? It's Lindsay Buckingham! Anyway, he's showing a picking technique, not tuning a guitar.
