I believe there is an element to this that is the need to put a lot of value in something like this.

When you find a problem in your system it might seem obvious when you hit the bug.

In these cases your solution may not be so obvious.
You might have the problem of a bad code.

It may even be your system that has been hacked in the past (yes, it is the code that has failed it).

It may have something to do with the current system it has created, as it is not well documented and the code you wrote for it is not particularly well documented or documented (e.g. no one knows what you wrote so there is a huge amount of code to be made by the user).

It's also not that you're being hacked into it, if the system works well your solution may not be very well designed.

You may have thought it would also be nice to keep your system simple enough that the code base can be optimized and optimized so it doesn't have to be that simple.

He has a very similar perspective when he was writing an article for Mashable (http://Mashable.com/about/)
