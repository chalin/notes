If I was going to sum up my experiences with Vue in a sentence, I’d probably say something like “it’s just so reasonable” or “It gives me the tools I want when I want them, and never gets in my way”. Again and again when learning Vue, I smiled to myself. It just made sense, elegantly.

This is *my own* introductory take on Vue. It’s the article I wish I had when I was first learning Vue. If you’d like a more non-partisan approach, please visit Vue’s very well thought out and easy to follow [Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).
