In this tutorial I will showcase the upcoming TensorFlow 2.0 features through the lense of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) by implementing an advantage actor-critic (A2C) agent to solve the classic CartPole-v0 environment. While the goal is to showcase TensorFlow 2.0, I will do my best to make the DRL aspect approachable as well, including a brief overview of the field.
