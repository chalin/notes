Description

It's always been on my musical bucket list to play an NPR tiny desk concert. This may be my chance! Either way, it was fun and cozy playing at this very tiny desk in this very beautiful room.

Many thanks to the MadeIn network for filming, Joe Hutchinson for running audio, Houston Station for letting us set up camp in their lovely space, and Chris Romeo for lending me her very, very tiny desk.

Lyrics

Call it like you see it, baby
Call it, call it anything that you please
A death in June, a fall in winter
Don't go pointing fingers
You asked for this disease

And I know you want to believe me
I know that you don't
But you could still pretend
And just because the math is simple
Doesn't mean it always
Evens out in the end

Performed it like a surgery
I emphasized the little things
The way I was shown
I laugh when I don't have the answers
When in the end I'm just trying
Not to go home

Congratulations, by the way
False teeth, what you'd hoped they'd say
Congratulations, by the way
Tell me what I need for you to say
