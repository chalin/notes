“Evaluating Technology” by Jeremy Keith – An Event Apart video
**~*December 18, 2018*~**

We work with technology every day. And every day it seems like there's more and more technology to understand: graphic design tools, build tools, frameworks and libraries, not to mention new HTML,CSS and JavaScript features landing in browsers. How should we best choose which technologies to invest our time in?

In this 60-minute presentation recorded live at [An Event Apart Denver 2017](https://aneventapart.com/event/denver-2017), [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/) helps you learn to evaluate tools and technologies in a way that best benefits the people who use the websites you design and develop. You’ll look at some of the hottest new web technologies like service workers and web components. And dig beneath the hype to find out whether they will really change life on the web for the better.

Jeremy Keith lives in Brighton, England where he makes websites with the splendid design agency [Clearleft](https://clearleft.com/). You may know him from such books as [DOM Scripting](https://domscripting.com/), [Bulletproof Ajax](https://bulletproofajax.com/), [HTML5 For Web Designers](https://aneventapart.com/news/post/evaluating-technology-by-jeremy-keith-aea-video), [Resilient Web Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com/), and, most recently, [Going Offline](https://abookapart.com/products/going-offline).

He also made the website [Huffduffer](https://huffduffer.com/) to allow people to make podcasts of found sounds—it‘s like Instapaper for audio files.
