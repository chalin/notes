Derivatives are Linear June 24, 2018 Studying artificial neural networks involves math that is way above me, but I’ve been plowing through and learning the prerequisite math as I go. A few days ago, I became really excited when I realized that the linearity of differentiation makes differentiating dot products naturally simple. Sums This is one of the first rules we learn about taking derivatives, usually by observing examples and concluding ourselves: d d x ∑ i u i ( x ) = ∑ i d d x u i ( x ) \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \sum_i u_i(x) = \sum_i \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} u_i(x)
