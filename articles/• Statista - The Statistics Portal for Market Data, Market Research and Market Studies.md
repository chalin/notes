###  5G network auction winnings in Germany 2019, by provider

This year’s 5G auction in Germany concluded with a sum total of over 6 billion euros in winnings for the German government. The money is paid by the four participating telecommunications providers listed in this statistic, with Deutsche Telekom spending the most at 2.17 billion euros. **What is 5G?** 5G, which stands for “fifth generation”, is a cellular network system for broadband connection that is being [eagerly supported](https://www.statista.com/chart/17506/5g-and-4g-comparison/) internationally. Advantages in comparison to previous technology include faster latency (time between an order given to a device and its completion) and better bandwidth. Considering that Germany still has [a lot of work to do](https://www.statista.com/chart/16419/mobile-interent-speed/) in terms of improving its mobile internet speed in particular, it’s understandable why 5G is an issue occupying both providers and consumers alike. Current frequencies are expected to be exhausted and not fit to hold up to rising data volume exchanges, which is why the 5G auction was held among Germany’s leading telecommunication companies. **5G and the future** 5G is hailed as being crucial for high quality, quicker mobile connectivity and improved network functions. While the enthusiasm from telecommunications providers is peaking, experts do warn that worldwide 5G coverage will take time, with [global implementation](https://www.statista.com/chart/9604/5g-subscription-forecast/) expected to roll out in 2021. In Germany this might happen even later.

###  National Basketball Association highest-paid players (salaries & endorsements) 2019

The graph shows the top-ten NBA players in terms of earnings (salary & endorsement deals) in 2019. LeBron James was the top-earning player in the National Basketball Association in 2019, with a salary of 35.7 million U.S. dollars and around 53 million U.S. dollars in off-court income. ** Highest paid NBA players – additional information **[NBA](https://www.statista.com/topics/967/national-basketball-association/) players have two main sources of revenues: salary from the team and endorsements. NBA players not only have deals with sports brands such as Nike and Adidas, but also with brands such as Coca-Cola, Panini, Kia Motors, Red Bull, to name a few. Shoe deals are particularly profitable for NBA players. Michael Jordan, for example, still profits from endorsements, as its signature shoes have a large share of the basketball shoe market. Thanks to endorsements, L.A. Lakers’ LeBron James is the highest-paid NBA player in 2019. During that year, James’ earnings stood at 88.7 million U.S. dollars, and about 60 percent of his earnings were generated from endorsements. Some of James' endorsements include Nike, Coca-Cola, Beats By Dre, Blaze Pizza and 2K Sports. Golden State Warriors' Steph Curry was the second highest-paid NBA player, with a salary of 37.5 million U.S. dollars and 42 million U.S. dollars in income from endorsement deals.

###  Opinion on proroguing Parliament to force a no-deal Brexit in Great Britain 2019

Close to half of British adults were opposed to the suggestion of forcing through a no-deal Brexit by 'proroguing' Parliament according to an opinion poll in June 2019. The idea of preventing MPs from voting against a no-deal Brexit by formally ending the Parliamentary session shortly before the Brexit deadline in October 2019 was brought forward by some candidates for the leadership of the UK's Conservative Party. Among Remain voters, 74 percent were opposed to prorogation, whereas 45 percent of Leave voters supported the idea.
