NeverSSL - helping you get online

# NeverSSL

## What?

This website is for when you try to open Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc on a wifi network, and nothing happens. Type "http://neverssl.com" into your browser's url bar, and you'll be able to log on.

## How?

neverssl.com will never use SSL (also known as TLS). No encryption, no strong authentication, no [HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security), no HTTP/2.0, just plain old unencrypted HTTP and forever stuck in the dark ages of internet security.

## Why?

Normally, that's a bad idea. You should always use SSL and secure encryption when possible. In fact, it's such a bad idea that most websites are now using https by default.

And that's great, but it also means that if you're relying on poorly-behaved wifi networks, it can be hard to get online. Secure browsers and websites using https make it impossible for those wifi networks to send you to a login or payment page. Basically, those networks can't tap into your connection just like attackers can't. Modern browsers are so good that they can remember when a website supports encryption and even if you type in the website name, they'll use https.

And if the network never redirects you to this page, well as you can see, you're not missing much.
