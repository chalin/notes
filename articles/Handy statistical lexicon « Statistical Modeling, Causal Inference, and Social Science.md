Posted by [Andrew](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/author/andrew/) on24 May 2009, 10:29 pm

These are all important methods and concepts related to statistics that are not as well known as they should be. I hope that by giving them names, we will make the ideas more accessible to people:

[Mister P](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2009/05/the_next_suprem/): Multilevel regression and poststratification.

[The Secret Weapon](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2005/03/the_secret_weap/): Fitting a statistical model repeatedly on several different datasets and then displaying all these estimates together.

[The Superplot](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2005/11/income_matters/): Line plot of estimates in an interaction, with circles showing group sizes and a line showing the regression of the aggregate averages.

[The Folk Theorem](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2008/05/the_folk_theore/): When you have computational problems, often there’s a problem with your model.

[The Pinch-Hitter Syndrome](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2005/01/the_pinchhitter/): People whose job it is to do just one thing are not always so good at that one thing.

[Alabama First](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2008/05/unalphabetize/): Howard Wainer’s term for the common error of plotting in alphabetical order rather than based on some more informative variable.

[The USA Today Fallacy](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2004/10/overrepresentat/): Counting all states (or countries) equally, forgetting that many more people live in larger jurisdictions, and so you’re ignoring millions and millions of Californians if you give their state the same space you give Montana and Delaware.

[Second-Order Availability Bias](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2005/10/red_and_blue_vo/): Generalizing from correlations you see in your personal experience to correlations in the population.

[The “All Else Equal” Fallacy](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2008/03/the_all_else_eq_1/): Assuming that everything else is held constant, even when it’s not gonna be.

[The Self-Cleaning Oven](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2007/09/style_guide_for/): A good package should contain the means of its own testing.

[The Blessing of Dimensionality](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2004/10/the_blessing_of/): It’s good to have more data, even if you label this additional information as “dimensions” rather than “data points.”

[The Chris Rock Effect](http://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2011/07/05/different_goals/): Some graphs give the pleasant feature of visualizing things we already knew, shown so well that we get a shock of recognition, the joy of relearning what we already know, but seeing it in a new way that makes us think more deeply about all sorts of related topics.

[The Freshman Fallacy](http://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2013/09/04/does-it-matter-that-a-sample-is-unrepresentative-it-depends-on-the-size-of-the-treatment-interactions/): Just because a freshman might raise a question, that does not make the issue irrelevant.

[The Garden of Forking Paths](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf): Multiple comparisons can be a problem, even when there is no “fishing expedition” or “p-hacking” and the research hypothesis was posited ahead of time.
