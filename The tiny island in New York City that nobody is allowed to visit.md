Most people have probably never heard of it but there is a tiny 100 by 200 foot island on the East River in New York City called U Thant Island. It’s right below Roosevelt Island and next to the United Nations headquarters and has more history per square foot than most places in Manhattan.

It’s origin dates back to the late 19th century when construction of an underground tunnel produced a tiny mound of rock that was originally named Belmont Island, after August Belmont Jr. who financed the construction project.

In the intervening years it was leased by a Buddhist spiritual group, crashed into by numerous vessels, and briefly occupied by a protesting artist.

Coast Guard: You can't come to this island. No one is allowed on it. This guy: Okay fine, I'll just canoe to about 3 feet from it, fake a crash, and stand on the island, and then post the video on Youtube. Coast Guard: -.- This guy: ....Please don't sue me!!!
