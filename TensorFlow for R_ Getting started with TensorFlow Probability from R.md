TensorFlow Probability offers a vast range of functionality ranging from distributions over probabilistic network layers to probabilistic inference. It works seamlessly with core TensorFlow and (TensorFlow) Keras. In this post, we provide a short introduction to the distributions layer and then, use it for sampling and calculating probabilities in a Variational Autoencoder.
