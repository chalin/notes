We saw in the previous section that any point on a two-dimensional surface can be expressed using a pair of Cartesian or polar coordinates. We also showed that there are transforms which allow us to switch between these two representations at will. A similar situation exists for signals. We may choose to represent signals using time-based coordinates or frequency-based coordinates. The Fourier Transform is our tool for switching between these two representations. I find it helpful to think of the frequency-domain representation as a
