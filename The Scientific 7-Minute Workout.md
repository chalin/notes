Description

I made this video to make the workout from New York Times article easier to follow along to: [http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05...](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/?ref=magazine)

It's designed to help you along whether or not you're looking at the video. I wasn't sure on the Side Planks, so instead of :15 each side, I chose to do :30 each.

Have fun.
