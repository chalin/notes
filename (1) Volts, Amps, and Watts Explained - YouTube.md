L3xou97  | Hair dryer bought in monaco would not work nice if you plug it in New York but I'm sure it will not blue smoke. In monaco the voltage is 230V and it's 110V in New York I think.

BattousaiHBr  | i dont understand A/h. if amps are how much current is flowing, then wouldnt mAh mean how much mA flow in 1 hour? wouldnt that serve the same purpose as kWh? both being units of energy that is.
