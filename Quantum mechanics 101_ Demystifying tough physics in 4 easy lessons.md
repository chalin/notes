Ready to level up your working knowledge of quantum mechanics? Check out these four TED-Ed Lessons written by Chad Orzel, Associate Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Union College and author of *How to Teach Quantum Physics to Your Dog.*

1. [Particles and waves: The central mystery of quantum mechanics](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/particles-and-waves-the-central-mystery-of-quantum-mechanics-chad-orzel)

One of the most amazing facts in physics is that everything in the universe, from light to electrons to atoms, behaves like both a particle and a wave at the same time. But how did physicists arrive at this mind-boggling conclusion? In this lesson, Orzel recounts the string of scientists who built on each other’s discoveries to arrive at this ‘central mystery’ of quantum mechanics.

2. [Schrödinger’s cat: A thought experiment in quantum mechanics](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/schrodinger-s-cat-a-thought-experiment-in-quantum-mechanics-chad-orzel)

Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger, one of the founders of quantum mechanics, posed this famous question: If you put a cat in a sealed box with a device that has a 50% chance of killing the cat in the next hour, what will be the state of the cat when that time is up? Orzel investigates this thought experiment.

3. [Einstein’s brilliant mistake: Entangled states](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/einstein-s-brilliant-mistake-entangled-states-chad-orzel)

When you think about Einstein and physics, E=mc^2 is probably the first thing that comes to mind. But one of his greatest contributions to the field actually came in the form of an odd philosophical footnote in a 1935 paper he co-wrote — which ended up being wrong. Here, Orzel details Einstein’s “EPR” paper and its insights on the strange phenomena of entangled states.

4. [What is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle?](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-is-the-heisenberg-uncertainty-principle-chad-orzel)

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that you can never simultaneously know the exact position and the exact speed of an object. Why not? Because everything in the universe behaves like both a particle and a wave at the same time. In his final lesson, Orzel navigates this complex concept of quantum physics.

Not quite, although Physics i a subject, most cases involve slow repetitive learning, while TED talks provide a quick insight into a new unexplored area for the person watching. So school becomes extraordinarily repetitive, especially since most work is done by building upon already know principles, and in most cases, simply combining them, no new work. In other words… I am sick of how boring and repetitive my school curriculum is, however that does help when studying, so what can you do.

With my dangerous half-knowledge I conclude that the solution to the “spooky action at a distance” („spukhafte* Fernwirkung“) in the entanglement video is that the two particles are really not separate at a higher spatial dimension, only appear so in our limited perception of three (spatial) dimension plus time. Once they have been together they will always be, everything is connected (as everything was together at the Big Bang). Christmas is typically a time where Westerners are more aware than usual that we are really all connected and our thoughts change the world through influencing quantum states. (See Gregg Braden’s “Divine Matrix” talk in Milan available at http://youtu.be/MRedvbARVhM – I don’t agree scientifically with everything he says, but scientists miss a trick by only nit-picking these popular pseudo-scientific spirits without realising that they are on to something with the practical points they’re making.)

* Pricelessly, at 2:44, the „spukhafte“ is written wrongly as „spuckhafte“. Spucken means to spit, so this would translate as “action at a distance like spitting”. „Spuckhaft“ could also mean jail for spitting but that goes too far.)

Re: Entangles States

The two paired particles could be functioning similar to two ends of a “tube” or “Cylinder” spinning on its axis. They have reverse rotations when both are looked at simultaneously. As in one end is spinning clockwise while the other is spinning counter-clockwise. All spinning objects are like this, I mentioned a tube though because the “ends” indicate separate locations. It just seems as though what they are measuring is essentially two opposite ends of a single “thing”. These opposing ends states are entangles just as the ends of a tube are entangles…except for in this case the “tube” or “cylinder” is invisible or escaping measurement. I have a diagram to explain this but can’t post it.

An apple has an inside and an outside, …..correct ? After all, how could it not have both an inside and an outside !

The universe also has an inside and an outside. After all, how could it not have both an inside and an outside !

However, in the world of physics, there is no attention being paid at all concerning the outside, nor do they even ponder the idea of there possibly being an outside. Thus the outside is totally rejected by today’s physicists.

An inside is different than an outside, thus the laws of physics on the outside of the universe are different than the laws of physics on the inside. An event can be governed from either of these two sides.

Whenever an event is governed from the outside, while being observed by today’s physicists on the inside, thanks to their ongoing total ignorance of the outside and the laws of physics on the outside, they see nothing but an event that has no fully explicable cause. They place such an event under the title “The Mysteriousness of Quantum Mechanics”.

Today’s physicists subconsciously have decided to leave the “outside” to those imaginative religious folk. In turn, the mysteries go on and on via today’s physicists demanding the acceptance of pure mysteriousness rather than finding the true cause or foundation. Thus there is an ongoing mere “acceptance” of Particle/Wave Duality, Action at a Distance, Entangled Pairs, Collapse of the Quantum Wave, Delayed Quantum Choice, Quantum Erasure, etc., yet there is absolutely no interest in the full explanation of each such bizarre phenomena.

However, if you include the laws of physics on the outside, all of these mysteries disappear in an instant. But, unfortunately, concerning this complete inside/outside understanding, today’s physicists currently have no interest at all in such completeness. Thus any presentation given of the outside laws of physics, is a useless presentation. It is ignored by the physics community in a nanosecond.
