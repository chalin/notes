These are the most popular brands and models of graphics tablets available in the US. The pressure-sensitive graphics tablets featured here are well-suited to both professional and home users who will be using the tablet for photo editing and digital art, or as a mouse replacement for everyday computing. We have deliberately excluded high-end digitizers for technical design and CAD work. Unless otherwise noted, these products are available for both Macintosh and Windows.

For creative work like painting, drawing, and touching up photos, the larger size of the Bamboo Create tablet is ideal.

The tablet features a number of programmable macro keys around the sides of the tablet, 1023 pressure sensitivity levels, 2540 LPI resolution, and 100 RPS report rate for speed. You also get an extra pen, batteries for both pens, and replacement nibs for the pens. We have not used the Monoprice tablets ourselves, but they have a high satisfaction rating on Amazon and we have had good experience with other Monoprice products.
