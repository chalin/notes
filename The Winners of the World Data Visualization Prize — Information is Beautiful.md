The Winners of the World Data Visualization Prize — Information is Beautiful

11 Feb 2019

# The Winners of the World Data Visualization Prize

The results are in. After combing through hundreds of impressive, insightful and creative entries, we’ve decided on the winners of the [World Data Visualization Prize 2019](https://wdvp.worldgovernmentsummit.org/).

Conducted in partnership with the [World Government Summit](https://www.worldgovernmentsummit.org/), the prize focuses on how governments are improving citizens’ lives. We asked entrants to use the power of data-visualization to illuminate data on the innovations and decisions – seen and unseen – that drive progress.

Scroll through the interactive, static and hand-drawn “napkin” category winners to see who took the grand prize of $25,000.

[**An Alternative, Data-Driven, Country Map**](https://projects.interacta.io/country-tsne/)

This dazzling, winning entry from Nikita Rokotyan uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to find previously-unseen connections and harmonies between different countries. It uses an AI technique called [t-SNE](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/) to discover clusters of nations that are related by happiness score, health expenditure, investment in education and many other variables. It then presents these patterns visually, creating an interactiv e world map that we can explore, tweak and filter to find unexpected pairings and insights. It uses design, code and artificial intelligence to bring data and statistics to life.
