**Ben Evans:** A Graphic Designer, full stack website designer & frontend web developer, specialising in well illustrated, animated and creative designs. Take website designs for example; I produce clean, functional, user friendly interfaces where every logo and illustration has a purpose. But that's just a part of it, design is my life. I have done nothing else in my spare time since before I can remember, from designing spaceships in Lego when I was a young boy, to designing ecommerce websites producing sales on average of Â£27,000 a week, or loyalty sites with over 35 million registered users, today. It's something I do before going to bed, and something I can't wait to do in the mornings.
