In this animated [Ted-Ed](http://ed.ted.com/) lesson by educator [Anita Collins](https://twitter.com/bb_brains), neuroscientists have found that [playing an instrument is a unique workout for the brain](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-playing-an-instrument-benefits-your-brain-anita-collins#digdeeper) as it activates numerous areas of the brain at the same time, a phenomenon that is not found in other activities.

**

> When you listen to music, multiple areas of your brain become engaged and active. But when you actually play an instrument, that activity becomes more like a full-body brain workout. What’s going on? Anita Collins explains the fireworks that go off in musicians’ brains when they play, and examines some of the long-term positive effects of this mental workout.
