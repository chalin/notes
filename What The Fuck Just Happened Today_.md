03/17/2017*Updated: 03/17/2017 04:20:46 PM PDT*

1/ **Trump offers no apology for claim on British spying**. Trump has stuck by his unsubstantiated assertion that Obama ordered his telephone tapped last year despite across-the-board denials and wryly used Merkel’s visit to repeat his contention that the White House had nothing to retract or apologize for. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/world/europe/trump-britain-obama-wiretap-gchq.html))

- **Sean Spicer flatly denies that the White House apologized to the British government** over the allegations that a UK intelligence agency wiretapped Trump Tower. Spokesman for UK Prime Minister says Britain has received assurances that claims won’t be repeated. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/17/politics/gchq-trump-wiretap-denial/))
- **Ryan, Senate Intel committee see no evidence of Trump wiretap**.

2/ **Britain’s surveillance agency says it’s “utterly ridiculous” that it was involved in the Trump “wiretap.”** The GCHQ – the British equivalent of the National Security Agency – usually remains tight-lipped on allegations, neither confirming nor denying claims. Not this time. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/17/britains-gchq-breaks-its-silence-to-slap-down-claim-it-was-involved-in-trump-wiretap/))

8/ **Trump affirms support for NATO but says member nations “must pay what they owe.”** Trump said some NATO countries owe “vast sums” in dues, which is “very unfair to the United States” — an allegation that appeared based on an incomplete understanding of how the alliance is funded.

03/16/2017*Updated: 03/16/2017 11:58:32 AM PDT*

1/ **Trump’s budget slashes funds for the EPA and State Department**. The budget would funnel an additional $54 billion into defense programs, beef up immigration enforcement, and significantly reduce the nondefense federal work force to further the “deconstruction of the administrative state,” in the words of Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. Major elements of the plan have already been declared dead on arrival by the Republican leadership in Congress, and much of the fiscal fine print will be filled in by Capitol Hill lawmakers and their aides over the next month.

([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/us/politics/trump-travel-ban.html))
- **Judges used Trump’s own words in ruling against his revised travel ban**. Two federal judges halted the Trump’s second attempt at his executive order, citing his campaign trail vows to seek a Muslim ban, which amounted to “significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus driving the promulgation of the Executive Order and its related predecessor.” ([Politico](https://secure.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-revised-travel-ban-judge-hearing-236086))

7/ **Trump will reexamine fuel efficiency standards set in place during the Obama administration**, opening the door for the regulations to potentially be reduced in the coming years.

5/ **Kellyanne Conway: “I don’t have any evidence” of Trump wiretapping claim**. Conway said that previous comments she made linking WikiLeaks’ release of nearly 8,000 documents that purportedly reveal secrets about the CIA’s tools for breaking into targeted computers, cellphones and smart TVs to Trump’s claims were about “surveillance generally” and not meant to be taken as specific proof that his allegation was true.

1/ **“Nobody will be worse off financially” under the GOP health care plan**, according to Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. He says no one will be adversely affected by the new bill once it’s enacted and that more people would be covered. *I bet.* ([NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/hhs-sec-tom-price-nobody-will-be-worse-financially-under-n732376))

- **The White House pledges no one “worse off” in Obamacare replacement** with sweeping promises that insurance premiums will fall and more people will have coverage under the replacement plan may be hard to keep as conservatives demand limits to government involvement in health care before they support the measure. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-03-12/white-house-pledges-no-one-worse-off-in-obamacare-replacement))
- **Trump budget chief: The President is focused on health care, not insurance coverage**. Mick Mulvaney said critics of the new GOP health care bill should not be too “worried about getting people coverage.” Preliminary analyses from Brookings Institution and Standard and Poor’s estimate that six to 15 million people could lose coverage under the Republican proposal for repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-budget-chief-president-focused-health-care-insurance/story?id=46076470))

4/ **McCain to Trump: Retract wiretapping claim or prove it**. The senator’s call for more information follows a request from two leading members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for “copies of any warrant applications and court orders — redacted as necessary… related to wiretaps of President Trump, the Trump Campaign, or Trump Tower.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/03/12/mccain-to-trump-retract-wiretapping-claim-or-prove-it/))

5/ **US attorney Bharara was fired after a standoff with Trump**. Bharara was asked for his resignation along with every other US attorney. His sudden dismissal came as a surprise since the US attorney had been told after a meeting with Trump in November that he could stay on. “I did not resign. Moments ago I was fired,” Bharara wrote in a tweet. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/11/politics/bharara-not-resigning/))

- **New York federal prosecutor Preet Bharara says he was fired by Trump administration**. Bharara had been asked to resign Friday, but confusion ensued because Trump in November had asked him to stay on.

- **Bharara was one of 46 U.S. attorneys appointed by Obama that the Trump administration asked to resign**. All presidents choose their own appointees for U.S. attorney positions and almost always ask those from their predecessors to leave. But the process under Trump was unusually abrupt, and it was yet another rocky encounter between the Trump administration and the nation’s law enforcement apparatus. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/11/us/politics/preet-bharara-us-attorney.html))

7/ **Democrats may abandon the Russia inquiry if it is not “legitimate.”** The Republican-controlled panel may offer their best chance for scrutinizing links between people close to President Trump and Russian officials, but some House Intelligence Committee Democrats are warning that they may pull their support for the inquiry if it becomes mired in party-line politics. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/11/us/politics/house-intelligence-commitee-russia-investigation.html))

03/11/2017*Updated: 03/11/2017 09:14:45 AM PST*

1/ **Trump abruptly orders remaining 46 U.S. attorneys to tender their resignations immediately**, sweeping away the remaining vestiges of the Obama administration’s prosecutors at the Justice Department. It is not unusual for a new president to replace United States attorneys appointed by a predecessor, especially when there has been a change in which party controls the White House. Other presidents, however, have done it gradually in order to minimize disruption. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/us/politics/us-attorney-justice-department-trump.html))

- **Anger mounts over handling of US attorney firings**. Many prosecutors had not been formally notified or even told before they were fired when the Justice Department announced the firings on Friday. ([CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/10/politics/us-attorneys-resignation/))
- **Preet Bharara has yet to submit his resignation letter as Trump demands U.S. attorneys resign**. Bharara met with Trump shortly after the election and was told that he would stay. Just this week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions assured him in a phone conversation that he’d remain atop the Southern District. ([The Daily Beast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/03/10/despite-trump-bharara-won-t-resign-yet.html))

2/ **Revised Trump travel ban suffers first legal setback** after a federal judge in Wisconsin barred enforcement of the policy to deny U.S. entry to the wife and child of a Syrian refugee already granted asylum in the United States. The temporary restraining order applies only to the family of the Syrian refugee. ([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-court-idUSKBN16I02F))

3/ **Scott Pruitt’s phones have been ringing off the hook since he questioned the link between human activity and climate change.** Pruitt’s comments on the CNBC program “Squawk Box” — that “we need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis” over climate change — prompted an immediate pushback from many scientists and environment groups. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/03/10/epa-administrator-scott-pruitt-call-your-office/))

5/ **White House official says Breitbart was source of Trump’s wiretaps claim**. A staffer placed the story, published on Breitbart, into Trump’s daily reading pile. The Breitbart article was a reprinted version of radio host Mark Levin’s on-air claim that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/white-house-confirms-source-of-trumps-wiretaps-claim-breitbart-2309643446.html))

6/ **Muhammad Ali Jr. questioned again at Washington airport**. Ali Jr. was trying to get his boarding pass at Reagan National airport in Washington, D.C. when the computer “flagged” him. The ticket agent rejected his Illinois state-issued ID and put Ali Jr. on the phone with the Department of Homeland Security. Ali Jr. was asked over the phone to verify his date of birth and where he was born. He was not asked about his religion. ([USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/03/10/muhammad-ali-jr-detained-again-airport-after-testimony/99031590/))

7/ **Trump’s plan for Medicaid could hurt the opioid abusers he promised to help**. The current version of the Trump-backed Republican health care plan would end the Obamacare requirement that addiction services and mental health treatment be covered under Medicaid in the 31 states that expanded the health care program. The GOP plan would instead leave it up to states – and their budgets – to decide whether or not to cover drug treatment and mental health services under Medicaid.

03/10/2017*Updated: 03/11/2017 09:14:47 AM PST*

1/ **Conservatives want to blow up Senate rules to kill Obamacare**. A growing number of conservative lawmakers urged GOP leaders to push the limits of how much of the health law they can reshape under a powerful procedural maneuver known as budget reconciliation — and to overrule the Senate parliamentarian if she doesn’t decide in their favor. ([Politico](https://secure.politico.com/story/2017/03/obamacare-conservatives-senate-rules-235896))

- **Trump supporters have the most to lose with the repeal of Obamacare**. The Republicans’ plan offers less help to older and lower-income Americans, especially in rural areas. The voters hit the hardest — eligible for at least $5,000 less in tax credits under the Republican plan — supported Trump by a margin of 59% to 36%. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/upshot/why-trump-supporters-have-the-most-to-lose-with-the-gop-repeal-bill.html))

2/ **House GOP leaders defend health-care overhaul as they prepare to meet Trump**. The leaders dismissed the suggestion from conservative members that the proposed phaseout of Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion should be moved up by two years, from 2020 to 2018. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-gop-leaders-defend-health-care-overhaul-as-they-prepare-to-meet-trump/2017/03/10/8eca839e-059b-11e7-ad5b-d22680e18d10_story.html))

([New York Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ag-jeff-sessions-calls-guantanamo-bay-fine-place-article-1.2994097))

4/ **Trump promised $1 trillion for infrastructure, but the real estimate is almost $4.6 trillion** over the next eight years to bring the country’s crumbling infrastructure up to an acceptable standard. A report by civil engineers gives the nation’s infrastructure a D-plus grade and sees little progress in the past four years.

5/ **The Office of Government Ethics says the Trump administration has an “incorrect” view of ethics laws**. The OGE urged punishment after Kellyanne Conway endorsed Ivanka Trump’s fashion line. The White House says the agency’s rules don’t apply to its workers. ([NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/09/519554307/u-s-ethics-official-to-white-house-no-these-rules-definitely-apply-to-you))

- **Ivanka Trump’s brand saw an online surge in February**. Sales of Ivanka Trump merchandise dropped 26 percent online in January compared to January 2016, but the trend reversed in February. According to Slice Intelligence, online sales of Ivanka Trump merchandise swelled 207 percent in February from the prior month. ([CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/09/ivanka-trumps-brand-saw-huge-online-surge-in-february.html))

6/ **States ask court to stop Trump’s new travel ban from ever taking effect**. At least five states are banding together in a legal drive to block key elements of Trump’s second travel ban.

([Politico](https://secure.politico.com/story/2017/03/states-seek-to-block-new-trump-travel-ban-executive-order-235888))

7/ **John Huntsman reported to be named next U.S. ambassador to Russia**. The former Republican governor served as ambassador to China under Obama. His appointment comes at a time when the complex relationship between the two countries has been particullary strained in light of recent developments surrounding the Trump administration. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/world/europe/jon-huntsman-jr-ambassador-russia.html))

8/ **Is Trump being investigated? “No comment,” the Justice Department says**. By venting his ire against Obama in a series of tweets last week, Trump awkwardly raised the possibility himself, since any wiretapping could have been the direct result of an investigation targeting him.

9/ **FBI investigation continues into “odd” computer link between Russian bank and Trump Organization**. Questions about the possible connection were widely dismissed four months ago. But the FBI’s investigation remains open and is in the hands of the FBI’s counterintelligence team – the same one looking into Russia’s suspected interference in the 2016 election.

12/ **A bill moving through Congress could give employers access to workers’ genetic test results**. The bill, HR 1313, was approved by a House committee on Wednesday, with all 22 Republicans supporting it and all 17 Democrats opposed. Employers may provide insurance premium discounts to workers who take part in their companies’ voluntary wellness programs. Once enrolled, businesses are allowed to collect “information about the manifested disease or disorder of a family member” of participating employees.

13/ **The U.S. added 235,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.7%**. Employers added jobs at an above-average pace for a second month.

1/ **The House Ways and Means Committee gave an approval to a major part of the Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act**, rejecting a flurry of Democratic amendments. Republicans are a step closer to a full vote on the measure despite the growing opposition of senators, health care providers, and some conservatives. The White House is increasingly confident about the prospects for a health care overhaul to pass in the House. Trump anticipates the most trouble in the Senate, where moderate and conservative lawmakers are opposing the plan for different reasons. He said he was prepared to pressure holdout senators by holding the kind of stadium-style rallies he led during his presidential campaign. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/us/politics/health-bill-clears-house-panel-in-pre-dawn-hours.html))

2/ **Trump goes into dealmaking mode, working behind the scenes on health bill** and quietly courting wary conservatives in private meetings and keeping himself somewhat out of the picture as party leaders and his Cabinet officials defend the proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act. “If we need to bring in the big gun, we’ll bring in the big gun” – meaning Trump. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-goes-into-dealmaking-mode-works-behind-the-scenes-on-health-bill/2017/03/08/1dc87bb2-0422-11e7-b9fa-ed727b644a0b_story.html))

4/ **Spicer attacks “double standard” in response to WikiLeaks dump**.

([CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/08/politics/white-house-wikileaks-donald-trump-cia-documents/))

5/ **The White House says Trump isn’t the target of any investigation** despite Trump’s unsubstantiated claim that Obama ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower. Either the president’s assertions that Obama wiretapped him are baseless, or he may have implicated himself in a government investigation of contacts between his presidential campaign and Russia.

9/ **Trump begins to map out his $1 trillion infrastructure plan** that would pressure states to streamline local permitting, favor renovation of existing roads and highways over new construction, and prioritize projects that can quickly begin construction. Trump expressed interest in high-speed rail and spectrum auction. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-begins-to-map-out-1-trillion-infrastructure-plan-1489012229))

The meeting is at odds with a spokeswoman’s claim that Trump had “zero” involvement with Russian officials during the campaign.

2/ **The rapport between Trump and Obama is unraveling**.

3/ **Aides address Trump’s wiretapping claims: “That’s above my pay grade.”** Trump’s team has been uncharacteristically muted when pressed about his explosive and unproven accusations that Obama wiretapped his phones in Trump Tower. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/us/politics/trump-wiretap-claim-obama.html))

5/ **FBI’s Comey says “you’re stuck with me” for another six years and intends to finish his full 10-year term as director**.

The plan is going to have to fight a three-front war to survive: 1) conservatives are calling this “Obamacare-Lite” or “Obamacare 2.0”; 2) moderates want to keep Medicaid expansion and Planned Parenthood funding; 3) and powerful/influential industry groups, like AARP and the American Hospital Association have voiced their opposition.

- **Ryan downplays conservative backlash against health-care plan**.

7/ **Democrats are trying to delay House GOP health care bill***. Democrats are complaining that the hearings are taking place before the Congressional Budget Office has a chance to “score” the House legislation, a process that will provide answers on how much it will cost and how many people it will cover.

03/07/2017*Updated: 03/07/2017 01:14:54 PM PST*

1/ **House Republicans unveiled their plan to replace Obamacare**. The plan scraps the mandate for most Americans to have health insurance in favor of a new system of tax credits to induce people to buy insurance on the open market. The bill would roll back the expansion of Medicaid that has provided coverage to more than 10 million people in 31 states, reducing federal payments for many new beneficiaries. The requirement for larger employers to offer coverage to their full-time employees would also be eliminated. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/affordable-care-act-obamacare-health.html))

- **The American Health Care Act: the Republicans’ bill to replace Obamacare, explained**. Two big questions — how many people it will cover and how much it will cost — are still unresolved: It will likely cover fewer people than the Affordable Care Act currently does. And the Congressional Budget Office has not yet scored the legislation, so its price tag is unknown. ([Vox](http://www.vox.com/2017/3/6/14829526/american-health-care-act-gop-replacement))

2/ **Chaffetz: Low-income Americans will have to choose health care over iPhones**. “Americans have choices, and they’ve got to make a choice. So rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest in their own health care. They’ve got to make those decisions themselves,” Chaffetz said. ([CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/07/politics/jason-chaffetz-health-care-iphones/))

3/ **With income-based tax credits, the GOP is considering an approach to health care it has long been against.** The GOP had intended to veer away from the ACA subsidies that help poor and middle-class people obtain insurance, insisting that the size of the tax credits should be based entirely on people’s ages and not their incomes. The latest draft proposed refundable tax credits that would hinge on earnings as well as age — providing bigger credits for older and poorer Americans. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/new-details-emerge-on-gop-plans-to-repeal-and-replace-obamacare/2017/03/06/04751e3e-028f-11e7-ad5b-d22680e18d10_story.html))

4/ **The GOP Obamacare replacement will defund Planned Parenthood and restrict abortion coverage.** The plan would keep poor women on Medicaid from getting health care at Planned Parenthood, and cut off affordable abortion coverage for many privately insured women. ([Vox](http://www.vox.com/identities/2017/3/6/14836998/obamacare-repeal-replace-bill-defund-planned-parenthood))

5/ **WikiLeaks released the “entire hacking capacity of the CIA.”** The documents describe the agency’s tools used to hack into smartphones and TVs, as well as to bypass encryption on programs like Signal and WhatsApp. The initial release, which WikiLeaks said was only the first part of the document collection, included 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments.

6/ **The UN says Trump’s revised travel ban will worsen plight of refugees**. Some of the Muslim-majority countries affected by the ban expressed their disappointment, insisting they had fully cooperated with US anti-terrorist efforts, saying refugees are not criminals. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/07/un-donald-trump-revised-travel-ban-refugees-muslim))

7/ **China warns of an arms race after the U.S. deployed a missile defense system in South Korea.** Beijing denounced the United States’ decision to use the Thaad technology and vowed to “take the necessary steps to safeguard our own security interests.” The U.S. deployed the defense system after North Korea launched four simultaneous missiles into the waters off the Japanese coast, which Pyongyang said was a drill for striking American bases in Japan.

03/06/2017*Updated: 03/07/2017 11:10:28 AM PST*

1/ **Trump signed a more limited executive order on immigration**. The revised travel ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from six of the seven countries named in Trump’s original order. People from Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Libya will face a 90-day suspension of visa processing. Iraq was removed from the list of countries affected. The order will keep in place a 120-day suspension of the refugee program, but it will no longer identify Syrian refugees as subject to an indefinite ban. The revisions are meant to help it withstand a court challenge. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/06/new-trump-travel-ban-muslim-majority-countries-refugees))

- **New executive order bans travelers from six Muslim-majority countries applying for visas**. Trump is preparing to sign a new executive order that imposes a 90-day ban on entry for new visa seekers from six majority-Muslim nations. The nation’s refugee program will also be suspended for 120 days, and it will not accept more than 50,000 refugees in a year, down from the 110,000 cap set by Obama.

5/ **Conway blames Trump’s wiretap dust-up on “double standard.”** Criticism directed at the president is unfair, Conway said, especially from the media that she complained has regularly cited anonymous sources in reports that have proven damaging to the Trump administration. Those same media outlets have too quickly dismissed Trump’s wiretapping allegation, Conway said. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-wiretap-obama-kellyanne-conway-235714))

1/ **Trump wants congressional probe of claims that Obama had him wiretapped during last year’s election, but won’t comment further**. Trump is “requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016,” Spicer said. ([USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/05/donald-trump-barack-obama/98774014/))

6/ **The Trump administration may be skirting its own ethics rules** by hiring of three former lobbyists to work in the White House. The administration appears to be either ignoring or exempting top staffers from its own watered-down ethics rules. ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-trump-administration-may-be-skirting-its-own-ethics-rules))

7/ **Trump angry and frustrated at staff over Sessions fallout for stealing his thunder in the wake of his address to Congress**. “Nobody has seen him that upset,” one source said, adding the feeling was the communications team allowed the Sessions news, which the administration deemed a nonstory, to overtake the narrative. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/04/politics/donald-trump-jeff-sessions-reince-priebus/))

8/ **Trump plans to sign updated travel ban early next week**.

9/ **Russia is the slow burn of the Trump administration, and it’s not going away.** Not much is known about the controversy, but that there were contacts is not in dispute.

1/ **Trump, citing no evidence, accuses Obama of “Nixon/Watergate” plot to wiretap Trump Tower** in the run-up to the election.

- **Obama denies Trump’s unsubstantiated accusation that he wiretapped phones in Trump Tower**.”A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,” Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis said in a statement Saturday. “As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen.

3/ **The U.S. can’t effectively counter a nuclear threat from North Korea**. Trump inherited a secret cyberwar against North Korean missiles designed to “manufacturing errors.” The threats pose such a danger that Obama warned Trump that a nuclear threat would likely be his most urgent problem. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/world/asia/north-korea-missile-program-sabotage.html))

4/ **Sessions will submit amended testimony and address Senators’ questions** over his contacts with Russia’s ambassador last year.

5/ **A growing list of contacts between Trump associates and Russia is drawing increased scrutiny**. Part of the problem underlying the disputed contact is Trump’s pugnacious style that leaves little room for nuance. At a news conference last month, he said that he had “nothing to do with Russia,” and that “to the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.” But in fact, reporting by multiple news organizations turned up multiple contacts between Trump associates and Russians who serve in or are close to Putin.

3/ **Trump’s blaming the Democrats for Cabinet delays that are normal — and his own fault**. It is true that, at one time, Senate Democrats were dragging their heels on Trump’s Cabinet picks.

The cuts to one of the government’s premier climate science agencies would reduce funding for research and satellite programs used for weather forecasts.

03/02/2017*Updated: 03/05/2017 08:07:07 AM PST*

1/ **Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia inquiry** and from any future investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. His conversations with the ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, came amid suspected Russian hacking directed at Clinton’s campaign. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/jeff-sessions-russia-trump-investigation-democrats.html))

- **Top Republicans call on Sessions to recuse himself from Russia investigation**. Some Democrats have called on Sessions to resign and have demanded an independent investigation. The calls from two of the House’s most prominent Republicans follow revelations that Sessions met with the Russian ambassador during election season. Under oath in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee for his confirmation hearing in January, Sessions had said that he had not met with any Russian officials. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/top-gop-lawmaker-calls-on-sessions-to-recuse-himself-from-russia-investigation/2017/03/02/148c07ac-ff46-11e6-8ebe-6e0dbe4f2bca_story.html))
- **Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer say Sessions perjured himself and demand that he resign**. “For the good of the country, Attorney General Jeff Sessions should resign,” Schumer said. Pelosi took the same position: “Sessions is not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country and must resign. There must be an independent, bipartisan, outside commission to investigate the Trump political, personal and financial connections to the Russians.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/jeff-sessions-russia-trump-investigation-democrats.html))

- **Sessions: “I will recuse myself” if necessary**. Sessions confirmed he met with the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before the presidential election in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee — not as a representative of the Trump campaign – and denied discussing the Trump campaign when he met with him. Kislyak is considered a top spy and is the same person who met with former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Republicans are resisting calls for a special prosecutor or select congressional committee to review the matter. ([Washington Post](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/pelosi-schumer-ryan-sessions.html))

3/ **The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee accused FBI Director James Comey of withholding information on Russia probe**. “In order for us to do our investigation in a thorough and credible way, we’re going to need the FBI to fully cooperate… to fully tell us the length and breadth of any counterintelligence investigations they are conducting,” Rep. Adam Schiff told reporters after emerging from a classified meeting with Comey. “At this point the director was not willing to do that.” Schiff raised the prospect of subpoenaing the agency. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/schiff-doj-235615))

4/ **Kushner and Flynn met with Russian envoy in December** to “establish a line of communication.” The extent and frequency of their contacts remains unclear, and the disclosure of the meeting at Trump Tower adds to the emerging picture of how the relationship between Trump’s incoming team and Moscow was evolving to include some of the president-elect’s most trusted advisers. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/kushner-flynn-sessions-russia.html))

As governor of Indiana, Pence communicated via his personal AOL account with top advisers on topics ranging from security gates at the governor’s residence to the state’s response to terror attacks across the globe. ([USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/02/mike-pence-private-email/98637782/))

- **New EPA head told Congress he never used personal email for government business. But it turns out he did.** Senators are demanding a review of the personal email account of Scott Pruitt after he said during confirmation hearings that he never used that account for official business as Oklahoma state attorney general. The result of an Open Records Act lawsuit shows Pruitt using his personal email address to conduct official state business, something he was not honest with the Senate about this during his confirmation process.

6/ **Paul Ryan’s feeling confident about repeal-and-replace. McConnell not so much**. Ryan and his top lieutenants are increasingly optimistic they will have the votes to pass their version of legislation to repeal the health-care law and replace some elements of it. In the Senate, McConnell can lose just two GOP senators and then use Vice President Pence to cast the tiebreaking vote to get the legislation to President Trump’s desk. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/paul-ryans-feeling-confident-about-repeal-and-replace-mcconnell-not-so-much/2017/03/02/d931b26a-ff59-11e6-8ebe-6e0dbe4f2bca_story.html))

- **Rand Paul protests outside room where House Republicans are hammering out an Obamacare replacement**. Paul couldn’t get a copy because the bill is still being drafted in private. Paul has described the passage of the ACA as an opaque and secret-laden process and that that Republican Party shouldn’t act the same way.

7/ **Trump’s team nixed ethics course for White House staff** that would have provided training on leadership, ethics and management. The program could have better prepared officials for working within existing laws and executive orders, and provided guidance on how to navigate Senate confirmation for nominees and political appointees, how to deal with congressional and media scrutiny, and how to work with Congress and collaborate with agencies. Sounds boring. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-ethics-white-house-235586))

8/ **The White House intentionally misled reporters** ahead of Trump‘s congressional address in order to generate positive press coverage as part of a “misdirection play.” The White House indicated Trump would embrace a more moderate tone on immigration in his speech. He made no such remarks. CNN’s Sara Murray called it a “bait-and-switch.” ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/321921-cnn-white-house-misled-reporters-on-trump-immigration))

9/ **The White House is fiercely divided over Trump’s campaign promise to “cancel” the Paris agreement**. The 2015 accord binds nearly every country to curb global warming.

1/ **Sessions met with Russians twice last year, but didn’t disclose the encounters during his confirmation hearing** when asked about possible contacts between members of Trump’s campaign and representatives of Moscow.

- **Graham and McCain want answers on Sessions-Russia report**.

2/ **Trump defended his tumultuous presidency and asked Congress to put aside its “trivial fights” to help ordinary Americans** in his first speech. Trump reiterated a host of familiar themes from his campaign and called for unity to address a litany of issues that he says are plaguing the country. “The time for small thinking is over,” Trump said. “The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts. The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls. And the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/us/politics/trump-address-congress.html))

> UPDATE:

**> Trump called on the Department of Homeland Security to “create an office to serve American victims” of crimes committed by immigrants**> . The Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) would provide “a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.” He made no explanation as to why the targets of crime perpetrated by immigrants should receive the support of a new federal government agency that apparently excludes the victims of crime committed by U.S. citizens.

2/ **House leaders are split on whether a Russian inquiry is needed**.

- **A guide for Trump’s first speech to Congress**. Instead of reflecting on the state of the U.S., like a State of the Union address, the first joint session speech is typically used to outline a new president’s goals for his administration. Trump will do exactly that — and try to downplay the chaos that has plagued his first 40 days in office. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trumps-first-speech-to-congress-235478))

7/ **Trump says Obama is helping organize protests against his presidency**. Trump has been dismissing the protests against his presidency and demonstrations at congressional town hall meetings across the country as concocted by his political enemies. “I think that President Obama is behind it because his people certainly are behind it,” Trump said. “In terms of him being behind things, that’s politics. It will probably continue.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/27/trump-says-obama-is-helping-to-organize-protests-against-his-presidency/))

The order, which will have almost no immediate legal effect and could take longer than a single presidential term to dismantle, directs E.P.A. chief Scott Pruitt to rewrite the 2015 rule known as the Waters of the United States. The rule gives the federal government broad authority to limit pollution in major bodies of water as well as in streams and wetlands that drain into them.

Trump is also expected to sign a similar order instructing Pruitt to begin the process of withdrawing and revising Obama’s 2015 climate-change regulation, aimed at curbing emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases from coal-fired power plants. In his former job as attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt led or took part in 14 lawsuits intended to block the E.P.A.’s major regulations, including the clean water and climate rules that he is now charged with dismantling.

10/ **Trump urges insurers to work together to “save Americans from Obamacare.”** Trump met with major health insurers in the midst of political divisions over how to dismantle and replace Obama’s signature health-care law and intensifying public pressure to preserve the policy.

10/ **Russia looks to exploit White House “turbulence”** as it’s becoming increasingly convinced that Trump will not fundamentally change relations with Russia. The Kremlin is instead seeking to bolster its global influence by exploiting what it considers weakness in Washington.

His proposal is for Trump to meet privately with Supreme Court justices who are interested in retirement. If one of those justices decided they would be willing to retire, and if Trump promises to nominate Garland, President Barack Obama’s unconfirmed former SCOTUS pick, in their place, then the retiring justice would submit a letter of resignation contingent on that promise.

02/24/2017*Updated: 03/05/2017 08:07:07 AM PST*

1/ **The New York Times, CNN and Politico were prohibited from attending a White House briefing by Trump’s press secretary**. Spicer allowed reporters from only a handpicked group of news organizations: Breitbart News, the One America News Network and The Washington Times, all with conservative leanings. Journalists from ABC, CBS, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, and Fox News also attended. “Nothing like this has ever happened at the White House in our long history of covering multiple administrations of different parties,” Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, said in a statement. “We strongly protest the exclusion of The New York Times and the other news organizations. Free media access to a transparent government is obviously of crucial national interest.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/us/politics/white-house-sean-spicer-briefing.html))

- **White House blocks news organizations from press briefing**. The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, Politico and BuzzFeed were excluded from the meeting, which is known as a gaggle and is less formal than the televised Q-and-A session in the White House briefing room. The gaggle was held by White House press secretary Sean Spicer. Asked whether CNN and The New York Times were blocked because the administration was unhappy with their reporting, Spicer responded: “Because we had it as pool, and then we expanded it, and we added some folks to come cover it. It was my decision to expand the pool.” ([CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/24/media/cnn-blocked-white-house-gaggle/))
- **In December, Spicer said barring media access is what a “dictatorship” does.** Today, he barred media access. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/02/24/in-december-spicer-said-barring-media-access-is-what-a-dictatorship-does-today-he-barred-media-access/))

2/ **Trump administration sought to enlist intelligence officials and key lawmakers to counter news stories about ties to Russia**. Acting at the behest of the White House, officials made calls to news organizations in an attempt to challenge stories about alleged contact between members of Trump’s campaign team and Russian intelligence operatives. The calls were orchestrated by the White House after unsuccessful attempts by the administration to get senior FBI officials to speak with news organizations and dispute the accuracy of stories on the alleged contacts with Russia. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-sought-to-enlist-intelligence-officials-key-lawmakers-to-counter-russia-stories/2017/02/24/c8487552-fa99-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html))

3/ **Trump to CPAC: “Now you finally have a president, finally.”** In a wide-ranging speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump blasted the media for its coverage of his administration and promised that the Republican Party would “be the party of the American worker.” Trump said that in a matter of days, he would have “brand new action” to keep the country safe, a reference to a second attempt at an executive order to restrict travel into the country from several majority-Muslim nations. At one point the crowd started chanting “lock her up” after Trump derided Hillary Clinton for describing some of Trump’s supporters as “deplorables.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/24/trump-to-become-first-president-since-reagan-to-address-annual-conservative-gathering/))

- **Trump intensified his slashing attack on the news media at CPAC**, reiterating his charge that “fake news” outlets are “the enemy of the people.” The opening portion of Trump’s free-range, campaign-style speech centered on a declaration of war on the press — a new foil to replace vanquished political opponents like Hillary Clinton. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/us/politics/trump-conservative-political-action-conference-speech.html))

4/ **Republican lawmakers expect that their Obamacare replacement will result in fewer Americans covered by health insurance**. The new plan would do away with the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that all Americans have health coverage or pay a fine, and replace it with rules that let people choose not to buy insurance, instead paying higher premiums or penalties if they need it later. The result would be fewer people covered. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-24/gop-obamacare-plan-would-cover-fewer-people-blowback-grows))

> UPDATE:

**> Leaked GOP Obamacare replacement would dismantle Obamacare subsidies and scrap its Medicaid expansion**> . The legislation would take down the foundation of Obamacare, including the unpopular individual mandate, subsidies based on people’s income, and all of the law’s taxes. It would significantly roll back Medicaid spending and give states money to create high-risk pools for some people with pre-existing conditions. Some elements would be effective right away; others not until 2020. (> [> Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/house-republicans-obamacare-repeal-package-235343)> )

6/ **Trump turned to manufacturing executives to help him develop measures to bring jobs back to the United States**, giving powerful business leaders a potentially influential hand in shaping his still-evolving economic policies. Trump has yet to outline specific proposals for overhauling the tax and regulatory systems, rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure or reshaping the work force, all of which would be essential to accomplishing his ambitious employment goals.

12/ **He yelled “get out of my country,” and then shot 2 men from India, killing one**. A 51-year-old man faces first-degree murder charges after shooting three men in an Olathe, Kansas bar Wednesday night.

## [Day 35:(Frayed.) Rejected.](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/02/23/Day-35/)

02/23/2017*Updated: 03/05/2017 08:07:07 AM PST*

1/ **The FBI rejected a White House request to publicly knock down media reports about communications between Trump’s associates and Russians** during the 2016 presidential campaign. Comey rejected the request for the FBI to comment on the stories, because the alleged communications between Trump associates and Russians known to US intelligence are the subject of an ongoing investigation. The White House did issue its own denial, with Priebus calling The New York Times story “complete garbage.” ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/23/politics/fbi-refused-white-house-request-to-knock-down-recent-trump-russia-stories/))

- **Paul Manafort faced blackmail attempt while he was Trump’s campaign chairman last summer**. Stolen text messages from his daughter’s phone appear to be threats to expose relations between Russia-friendly forces, Trump, and Manafort. Manafort confirmed the authenticity of the texts and added that, before the texts were sent to his daughter, he had received similar texts to his own phone number from the same address. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/paul-manafort-blackmail-russia-trump-235275))
- **House Republicans plan to derail a Democratic resolution that would force disclosure of Trump’s potential ties with Russia and any possible business conflicts of interest**. Democrats have blasted Trump for failing to make a clean break from his real estate empire, accusing him of being vulnerable to conflicts of interest. They also are suspicious of his campaign’s relationship with Russia. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that top Russian officials orchestrated interference into the 2016 presidential election on Trump’s behalf. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-conflicts-house-resolution-235288))

2/ **Trump touts recent immigration raids, calling them a “military operation”**. The effort to ramp up deportations are aimed at ridding the U.S. of “really bad dudes.” Under the administration’s guidelines, any immigrant who is convicted, charged or suspected of a crime is considered a priority for removal. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/23/trump-touts-recent-immigration-raids-calls-them-a-military-operation/))

- **Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly promised there will not be any military force used in immigration enforcement**. The statement contradicts what President Trump had said hours before when he referenced Kelly’s and Secretary of State Tillerson’s trip to Mexico. ([CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dhs-secretary-says-no-use-of-military-forces-in-immigration/))
- **Spicer: Trump didn’t mean “military operation” literally**. Spicer added that “the president was clearly describing the manner in which this is being done.” ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/320895-spicer-trump-didnt-mean-military-operation-literally))

3/ **Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly head to Mexico amid deep strains in bilateral ties** in what is expected to be the first in a series of high-level meetings focusing on drug trafficking, trade and immigration. Twin threats hang over the frayed relationship between the two nations: Trump’s new orders to round up and deport immigrants who are in the United States illegally, and a separate effort to take a hard look at all American aid to Mexico, possibly using it to pay for a border wall instead. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/world/americas/rex-tillerson-mexico-border-relations.html))

4/ **Trump wants to make sure U.S. nuclear arsenal at “top of the pack”**, saying the United States has fallen behind in its weapons capacity. Trump said in the interview he would like to see a world with no nuclear weapons but expressed concern that the United States has “fallen behind on nuclear weapon capacity.” ([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-exclusive-idUSKBN1622IF))

5/ **Trump has largely benched the State Department from its long-standing role as the pre­eminent voice of U.S. foreign policy**, curtailing public engagement and official travel and relegating Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to a mostly offstage role. Tillerson has also been notably absent from White House meetings with foreign leaders. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/in-first-month-of-trump-presidency-state-department-has-been-sidelined/2017/02/22/cc170cd2-f924-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html))

6/ **Trump has assigned the Department of Homeland Security, working with the Justice Department, to help build the legal case for its temporary travel ban**. Some administration intelligence officials see the White House request as the politicization of intelligence. One of the ways the White House hopes to make its case is by using a more expansive definition of terrorist activity than has been used by other government agencies in the past. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/23/politics/white-house-effort-to-justify-travel-ban-causes-growing-concern-for-some-intel-officials/))

7/ **Repeal of Obamacare face obstacles in House, not just the Senate**. Conservative Republicans are pushing for a fast repeal with only a bare-bones replacement plan, but moderates are interested in coming up with a clear and robust plan. It’s becoming increasingly likely that a consensus in the House may be just as hard to reach. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/us/politics/obamacare-affordable-care-act-house-republicans.html))

- **John Boehner: a full repeal and replace of Obamacare is “not going to happen.”** He said changes to former President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement would likely be relatively modest. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/john-boehner-obamacare-republicans-235303))

8/ **Protests break out after an off-duty LAPD officer fired his gun in a scuffle with teens**. No one was shot. The officer detained a 13-year-old boy after he allegedly threatened to shoot him. The officer has been placed on administrative leave while the Force Investigation Division conducts an investigation to “determine whether the use of deadly force complied with LAPD’s policies and procedures.” ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/23/us/anaheim-protest-police-teen-fight/))

9/ **New research suggests that private school vouchers may harm students who receive them**. Voucher advocates often cite poor test scores in public schools to justify creating private school vouchers in the first place. The new evidence on vouchers does not seem to have deterred the Trump administration, which has proposed a new $20 billion voucher program. Secretary DeVos’s enthusiasm for vouchers, which have been the primary focus of her philanthropic spending and advocacy, appears to be undiminished. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/upshot/dismal-results-from-vouchers-surprise-researchers-as-devos-era-begins.html))

10/ **McCain made a secret trip to Syria to meet with U.S. troops and Kurdish fighters amid their longstanding battle to defeat ISIS**. The trip comes as Trump administration continues to re-evaluate the U.S. plan to defeat ISIS. On the campaign trail, Trump frequently criticized Obama’s policy to defeat the group, which controls territory in both Syria and neighboring Iraq. ISIS has lost significant territory in the last two years. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mccain-makes-secret-trip-syria-meet-us-military/story?id=45680390))

- **Iraqi forces storm Mosul airport in a push to recapture the city from Islamic State**. The advance into the airport will allow Iraqi troops to launch operations into the fortified western suburbs, where several thousand of Isis’s most seasoned fighters have prepared defences. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/23/iraqi-forces-storm-mosul-airport-seize-isis))

11/ **Trump’s plan to hire 15,000 border patrol and ICE agents won’t be easy**. The time to recruit and hire Border Agents, administer medical exams and drug screening, polygraph tests, fitness tests, and training could take a year or more to bring a new agent on board.

1/ **Trump’s immigration crackdown will likely bring a flood of lawsuits**.

DeVos initially resisted signing off on the order, telling Trump that she was uncomfortable with it. Sessions, who strongly opposes expanding gay, lesbian and transgender rights, fought DeVos on the issue and pressed her to relent because he could not go forward without her consent. The order must come from the Justice and Education Departments. Trump sided with Sessions, while DeVos, faced with the choice of resigning or defying the president, has agreed to go along.

1/ **Homeland Security unveils a sweeping plan to deport undocumented immigrants**.

**> Trump keeps DACA but chips away at barriers to deportation**> .

- **New Trump deportation rules make it easier to deport people immediately**. Under the Obama administration, expedited removal was used only within 100 miles of the border for people who had been in the country no more than 14 days. Now it will include those who have been in the country for up to two years, and located anywhere in the nation. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/us/politics/dhs-immigration-trump.html))

2/ **Trump: Anti-Semitism “has to stop”**. Trump denounced anti-Semitism after coming under pressure to address an uptick in incidents targeting Jewish institutions across the U.S. Trump has insisted he has spoken out against anti-Semitism “whenever I get a chance,” even though he has refused to confront the issue directly on multiple occasions. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/320412-trump-anti-semitism-has-to-stop))

> UPDATE:

**> Anne Frank Center criticizes Trump’s denouncement of anti-Semitism a “pathetic asterisk of condescension”**> . Trump refused to address a series of bomb threats against Jewish community centers when asked about the threats by a Jewish journalist last week. Trump cut the journalist off and said “I hate even the question.” The White House’s statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day also left out any mention of Jews.

3/ **Trump has insisted that he had no contact with Russia during the campaign. Russia says otherwise**. Russian officials have at least twice acknowledged contact with Trump aides before the election. That contact would have taken place during the period when it’s believed that the Russian government was trying to disrupt the election. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/us/politics/donald-trump-russia.html))

- **Chuck Schumer: Jeff Sessions must recuse himself from the Flynn investigation**. The gravity of Flynn’s contact with the Russians and the reports that he may have lied to the FBI cannot be overstated or ignored. Revelations about that contact may be only the tip of the iceberg. There’s an overwhelming view in our intelligence community that Russia tried to influence our election.

4/ **Bannon told Germany that the EU is flawed** a week before Pence pledged America’s “steadfast and enduring” commitment to the European Union. The encounter unsettled people in the German government, in part because some officials had been holding out hope that Bannon might temper his views once in government and offer a more nuanced message on Europe in private. ([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-trump-idUSKBN1601DS))

5/ **The Trump White House is already cooking the books**. The Trump transition team ordered the Council of Economic Advisers to predict sustained economic growth of 3 to 3.5%. The staffers were then directed to backfill all the other numbers in their models to produce these growth rates.

6/ **Trump energizes the anti-vaccine movement in Texas**. Trump’s embrace of discredited theories linking vaccines to autism has energized the anti-vaccine movement. Once fringe, the movement is becoming more popular, raising doubts about basic childhood health care among politically and geographically diverse groups. Public health experts warn that this growing movement is threatening one of the most successful medical innovations of modern times.

7/ **Trump’s nominees gripe that the White House isn’t protecting them**.

02/20/2017*Updated: 03/05/2017 08:07:07 AM PST*

1/ **Pence met with open skepticism in Brussels**. “Too much has happened over the past months in your country, and in the EU,” Donald Tusk said, European Council President. “For us to pretend that everything is as it used to be.” Pence came to the European Union to reassure them that Trump actually supports the 28-nation bloc and that the US will continue its commitment despite the partial disintegration Trump has hailed. Pence was insistent that support for the alliance was a bedrock of US policy. But he demanded that other member nations scale up their defense spending to meet NATO’s requirements, a longstanding request of US presidents that Trump has amplified. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/20/politics/pence-europe-brussels/))

- **Tusk asked Pence whether the Trump administration was committed to three things:** 1) maintaining an international order based on rules and laws, 2) whether Trump was committed to NATO, and 3) whether Europe could count “as always in the past, on the United States’ wholehearted and unequivocal, let me repeat, unequivocal support for the idea of a united Europe.” Pence said “yes” to all three. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/world/europe/pence-european-union-trump.html))

2/ **Trump names Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster as national security adviser, replacing the ousted Michael Flynn**. Kellogg, who has been serving in an acting capacity as national security adviser, will be the chief of staff on the National Security Council. Trump shared the news with reporters as he prepared to leave his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/02/20/trump-names-army-lt-gen-h-r-mcmaster-as-national-security-adviser-replacing-the-ousted-michael-flynn/))

3/ **US Defense Secretary, James Mattis told reporters, “We’re not in Iraq to seize anybody’s oil.”** His comments are a departure from Trump who said, “We should have kept the oil. Maybe we’ll have another chance.” ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/20/politics/mattis-baghdad-visit/))

4/ **Revised travel ban targets same seven countries** listed in Trump’s original executive order and exempts travelers who already have a visa to travel to the U.S. The new draft also no longer directs authorities to single out — and reject — Syrian refugees when processing new visa applications. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/ap-source-trumps-revised-travel-ban-targets-same-countries/2017/02/19/e09c9ab2-f70a-11e6-aa1e-5f735ee31334_story.html))

6/ **Trump to roll back Obama’s climate and water pollution rules through executive action**. While both directives will take time to implement, they will send an unmistakable signal that the new administration is determined to promote fossil-fuel production and economic activity even when those activities collide with some environmental safeguards. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/02/20/trump-to-roll-back-obamas-climate-water-rules-through-executive-action/))

7/ **Statisticians worry about alternative economic facts** and doctored data from the government if the economy turns sour. Trump has yet to nominate anyone to the Council of Economic Advisers, established in 1946 to provide presidents with objective economic analysis and advice. The fears about data manipulation arise from the nontraditional approach the Trump administration has taken to interpreting economic data. Trump has has repeatedly cast the “real” unemployment rate as far above the official rate, using figures that incorporate all those of working age who aren’t employed. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-20/trump-team-fosters-fears-he-ll-adopt-alternative-economic-facts))

> UPDATE:

**> Trump is basing his budget projections on the assumption that the U.S. economy will grow almost twice as fast as independent institutions like the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve expect**> . The Trump team is apparently projecting growth at between 3 and 3.5 percent for a decade. This wouldn’t be unprecedented: the U.S. economy grew at a 3.4 percent rate during the Reagan years, 3.7 percent under Bill Clinton. (> [> New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/opinion/on-economic-arrogance.html)> )

8/ **Republican health proposal would redirect money from poor to rich**. The Republican plan would substantially cut funding for states in providing free insurance to low-income adults through Medicaid. And would change how tax credits are distributed by giving all Americans not covered through work the same flat credit by age, regardless of income. The draft proposal largely contains provisions that could be passed through a special budget process that requires only 50 Senate votes, and fulfills President Trump’s promise that the repeal and replacement of the law would take place “simultaneously.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/upshot/republican-health-proposal-would-redirect-money-from-poor-to-rich.html))

([NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/employees-across-u-s-fired-after-joining-day-without-immigrants-n722991))

10/ **Trump’s Navy secretary nominee on the verge of withdrawing**. Philip Bilden, a former Army Reserve military officer with little naval experience, has drawn resistance to his lack of familiarity with Navy issues and has encountered difficulty separating himself from his financial interests.

02/19/2017*Updated: 03/05/2017 08:07:07 AM PST*

1/ **“Last night in Sweden”? Trump’s remark baffles a nation**. During a campaign-style rally on Saturday in Florida, Trump issued a sharp if discursive attack on refugee policies in Europe, ticking off a list of places that have been hit by terrorists. Nothing particularly nefarious happened in Sweden on Friday — or Saturday, for that matter — and Swedes were left baffled. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/world/europe/last-night-in-sweden-trumps-remark-baffles-a-nation.html))

> UPDATE:

**> Trump clarifies remarks on Sweden: I got it from Fox News story**> . Trump confirmed speculation that a Fox News story about immigration and crime rates that aired on Tucker Carlson’s show was the origin of his statement.

- **Trump cites non-existent terror attack**, possibly confusing it with Sehwan in Pakistan. The source of Trump’s remark is unclear, but it came after Fox News aired an interview with film-maker Ami Horowitz, whose latest documentary examines whether high crime rates in areas of Sweden is linked to its previous open-door policy on people fleeing war and persecution. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/19/sweden-trump-cites-non-existent-terror-attack))

([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/02/19/fact-checking-president-trumps-rally-in-florida/))

2/ **Memos signed by DHS secretary describe sweeping new guidelines for deporting illegal immigrants**. The new guidelines empower federal authorities to more aggressively detain and deport illegal immigrants inside the United States and at the border. A White House official said the memos were drafts and that they are under review by the White House Counsel’s Office, which is seeking some changes. The memos do not include measures to activate National Guard troops.

4/ **Defense Secretary Mattis disagrees with Trump, says he does not see media as the enemy**. Mattis, asked directly about Trump’s criticism of the media, said he has had “some rather contentious times with the press” but considers the institution “a constituency that we deal with.” The defense secretary added: “I don’t have any issues with the press myself.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/02/19/defense-secretary-mattis-disagrees-with-trump-says-he-does-not-see-media-as-the-enemy/))

> UPDATE:

**> Fox News anchor Chris Wallace warns viewers: Trump crossed the line in latest attack on media**> . Trump’s contentious relationship with the press has again been in the spotlight after the president repeatedly attacked the media as “fake news”. All presidents fight with the media, but Trump had taken it a step further in making them out to be “the enemy,” Wallace said.

- **Fox News host Chris Wallace to Priebus: “You don’t get to tell” the press what to do**. Priebus argued that the media has not covered Trump’s actions as closely as it has covered his notable failures, calling “unsourced” stories about turmoil inside Trump’s administration “total garbage.” On Saturday, Priebus said Trump should be taken “seriously” in his claim that the news media is “the enemy of the American People.” ([Talking Points Memo](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/chris-wallace-reince-priebus-trump-comment-about-press))

**> Senators want Russia-related materials preserved**> . The Senate Intelligence Committee is asking more than a dozen agencies, organizations and individuals to preserve communications related to the panel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The move comes amid inquiries into whether Trump’s campaign officials were in contact with Russian officials and other Russians known to US intelligence during the 2016 race. (> [> CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/19/politics/senate-intelligence-committee-russia-materials/index.html)> )

7/ **Foreign policy experts find scant reassurance in Trump’s plans**. At the Munich Security Conference, diplomats, generals, policy experts, and security officials were deeply disturbed by Trump’s difficulty finding a pliant national security adviser to replace Michael Flynn, and by Trump’s long and rambling news conference on Thursday, which was followed Saturday with a campaign-style rally where he suggested, wrongly, that something terrible had happened in Sweden. Pence, who carried a direct message of reassurance from Trump, could not manage to comfort many of the experts. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/world/a-worried-europe-finds-scant-reassurance-on-trumps-plans.html))

> UPDATE:

**> Trump meets with four candidates for National Security Adviser**> . Trump’s first choice to succeed Flynn turned down the job. The White House has had trouble filling some senior positions in part because so many experienced Republicans criticized Trump during the campaign, and he has vetoed choices over that.

1/ **Pence: US will hold Russia accountable and stands with NATO**. Trump has repeatedly called NATO “obsolete,” but U.S. officials appear to be concentrating more on pushing allies to meet NATO defense spending commitments rather than focusing on Trump’s desire for a new relationship with the Kremlin, a major fear in Europe. Many European allies see Russia as a security threat following its 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/pence-and-merkel-embrace-nato-but-differ-on-transatlantic-partnership/2017/02/18/909c6a92-f55c-11e6-9fb1-2d8f3fc9c0ed_story.html))

2/ **The F.B.I. is pursuing at least three separate probes relating to alleged Russian hacking of the U.S. presidential elections**. The FBI’s Pittsburgh office is trying to identify the people behind breaches of the Democratic National Committee’s computer system. The bureau’s San Francisco office is trying to identify the people who posted John Podesta’s stolen emails. And, agents based in Washington are pursuing leads from informants, foreign communications intercepts, and financial transactions by Russian individuals and companies who are believed to have links to Trump associates. ([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-cyber-idUSKBN15X0OE))

3/ **The White House abruptly dismissed a senior National Security Council aide** after his harsh criticism of Trump at a private, off-the-record think tank gathering. The aide laced into Trump, his chief strategist Steve Bannon, as well as Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/white-house-nsc-aide-craig-deare-dismissed-235175))

4/ **Trump down to three candidates to replace Flynn** after former CIA Director David Petraeus pulled his name from consideration for National Security Adviser. Still on the short list for the position are acting national security adviser Keith Kellogg, former United Nations ambassador John Bolton, and Army strategist Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/320206-petraeus-no-longer-being-considered-to-replace-flynn-report))

([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-idUSKBN15X0O6))

- **Legal analysts said a new executive order that maintains bans would not likely allay the concerns of federal judges** who put the original order on hold. Even if Trump made clear his order did not apply to green-card holders, or limited it so that it affected only those applying for visas, a three-judge panel with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit said that would not necessarily convince them to lift their freeze. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/dhs-secretary-trump-administration-considering-more-streamlined-version-of-travel-ban/2017/02/18/4f8cb56c-f5f6-11e6-b9c9-e83fce42fb61_story.html))

6/ **Trump yells at CIA Director Mike Pompeo** for not pushing back hard enough against reports that the intelligence community was withholding information from him. The White House denied the report. The president “did not yell at the CIA director,” a White House spokesperson said.

7/ **DeVos criticizes teachers after visiting D.C. school — and they are not having it**. After visiting D.C.’s Jefferson Middle School Academy, DeVos said teachers at Jefferson seemed to be in “receive mode. They’re waiting to be told what they have to do, and that’s not going to bring success to an individual child.” The school responded to DeVos on Twitter, saying “We’re about to take her to school.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2017/02/18/devos-criticized-teachers-at-d-c-school-she-visited-and-they-are-not-having-it/))

8/ **Popular domestic programs could face budget cuts**. Trump’s budget office has drafted a hit list of programs that could be eliminated or have their domestic spending trimmed. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Legal Services Corporation, AmeriCorps, and the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities are on that list. Most of the programs cost under $500 million annually, a pittance for a government that is projected to spend about $4 trillion this year.

9/ **Ben Carson “baffled” and “speechless” at the firing of one of his Housing and Urban Development staffers**.

(10/ **Leaked Trump tape: “You are the special people”**. While meeting potential Cabinet nominees in November, Trump invited partygoers at his New Jersey golf club to stop by to join him on staff interviews. “We’re doing a lot of interviews tomorrow — generals, dictators, we have everything,” Trump told the crowd. “You may wanna come around. It’ll be fun. We’re really working tomorrow. We have meetings every 15, 20 minutes with different people that will form our government.” ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-leaked-audio-clubs-guests-235161)))[Editor’s Note: This story was removed because it is speculative.]

10/ **The first casualties of Trump’s trade wars are Texas cattle ranchers**. By threatening a trade war with Mexico within days of inauguration, the president helped trigger a slide in cattle futures. Mexico is a major export market. By sinking the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the new administration cut off long-sought access to the Japanese market. Now banks have raised the conditions for collateral for loans for ranchers.

1/ **Trump weighs mobilizing National Guard for immigration roundups**. A draft memo proposes to mobilize 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants, including millions living nowhere near the Mexico border. The 11-page document calls for the unprecedented militarization of immigration enforcement as far north as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New Orleans, Louisiana.

Pruitt’s confirmation marked a serious defeat for environmental advocacy groups. Pruitt has sued the EPA more than a dozen times during the Obama administration, challenging the agency’s authority to regulate toxic mercury pollution, smog, carbon emissions from power plants and the quality of wetlands and other waters. In Oklahoma, he dismantled a specialized environmental protection unit that had existed under his Democratic predecessor and established a “federalism unit” to combat what he called “unwarranted regulation and systematic overreach” by Washington. Pruitt cleared the Senate by a vote of 52-46.

The chairman of the House Oversight Committee, who has refused Democratic requests to investigate possible conflicts of interest involving Trump, is seeking criminal charges against a Bryan Pagliano, the former State Department employee who helped set up Hillary Clinton’s private email server. Chaffetz sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions asking him to convene a grand jury or charge Pagliano.

11/ **Ryan struggles to sell tax reform plan to fellow Republicans**. Ryan has framed his proposal as a compromise between a tariff, which the president wants, and conservative orthodoxy against border taxes. He has suggested it’s in keeping with Trump’s “America first” mantra, since it would reward American manufacturers that make products here and sell it abroad. But the idea is sharply dividing Republicans — even within the White House. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/paul-ryan-tax-reform-republicans-235117))

12/ **Trump promises new immigration order as DOJ holds off appeals court**. Trump said his administration will issue “a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people” next week. The Justice Department wrote at length in a 47-page about the “seriously flawed” Ninth Circuit ruling from last week, but neverthless said: “(r)ather than continuing this litigation, the President intends in the near future to rescind the order and replace it with a new, substantially revised executive order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns.” ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/16/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban-executive-order/index.html))

02/16/2017*Updated: 03/05/2017 08:07:07 AM PST*

1/ **Donald Trump delivered a series of raw and personal attacks on the media in a news conference for the ages**. It was a return to what worked for him during the course of the 2016 campaign: A circuslike atmosphere in which he used the media — and his supporters’ distrust of the media — as a sort of tackling dummy to re-center the narrative on ground more favorable to him. Trump didn’t just run down the media — although he did a lot of that — but he also mocked various outlets, reviewed shows on cable TV that he likes (and doesn’t), told reporters to sit down and be quiet, and critiqued the quality of the questions he was being asked. There was a rawness to his attacks, a personal invective that seemed well beyond the typically antagonistic relationship that exists between the media and the president they cover. This was not a piece of political strategy. This came right from Trump’s gut. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/16/donald-trump-delivers-a-series-of-raw-and-wild-attacks-on-the-media-in-a-press-conference-for-the-ages/))

5/ **White House plans to have a Trump ally review intelligence agencies**. Trump’s plan to assign a New York billionaire to lead a broad review of American intelligence agencies has members of the intelligence community fearing it could curtail their independence and reduce the flow of information that contradicts the president’s worldview.

6/ **The Kremlin ordered state media to cut way back on their fawning coverage of Trump**, reflecting a growing concern among senior Russian officials that the new U.S. administration will be less friendly than first thought.

8/ **ICE detains woman seeking domestic abuse protection at Texas courthouse**.

> UPDATE:

**> The White House has found ways to end protection for “Dreamers” while shielding Trump from blowback**> . Trump’s aides have examined at least two options for repealing DACA that would not directly involve Trump: a lawsuit brought by states, and new legal guidance that details who is a priority for deportation. Trump has repeatedly promised to end the program on “day one” of his presidency and called the protections “unconstitutional executive amnesty.” (> [> Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-daca-20170216-story.html)> )

9/ **Leaked emails show Justice Clarence Thomas’s wife pushing travel ban**. In an email sent to a conservative listserv, Ginni Thomas asked for advice on how to organize in favor of Trump’s travel ban. But by doing so, she may have inadvertently made it harder for the executive order to survive the Supreme Court. ([The Daily Beast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/02/16/leaked-emails-show-justice-clarence-thomas-s-wife-pushing-travel-ban.html))

10/ **Trump signs law rolling back disclosure rule for energy and mining companies**. The bill cancels out a Securities and Exchange Commission regulation that would have required oil and gas and mining companies to disclose in detail the payments they make to foreign governments in a bid to boost transparency in resource-rich countries.

11/ **The Endangered Species Act may be heading for the threatened list**. A Senate hearing to “modernize the Endangered Species Act” unfolded just as supporters of the law had feared, with round after round of criticism from Republican lawmakers who said the federal effort to keep species from going extinct encroaches on states’ rights, is unfair to landowners and stymies efforts by mining companies to extract resources and create jobs.

**> EPA workers try to block Trump’s contentious nominee to run the agency in show of defiance**> . Employees of the EPA have been calling their senators, urging them to vote against the confirmation of Scott Pruitt.

1/ **Trump campaign aides had repeated contact with Russian intelligence** during the 2016 campaign according to four current and former American officials. Phone records and intercepted calls show that the communications happened around the same time evidence was discovered that Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee. U.S. intelligence agencies sought to learn whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election. They have seen no evidence of such cooperation, so far. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/russia-intelligence-communications-trump.html))

> UPDATE:

**> It’s bigger than Flynn. New Russia revelations widen Trump’s credibility gap**> . Trump’s long-term fixation on and admiration for Vladimir Putin as well as Flynn’s departure has lent new gravity and intensity to long-simmering questions about Trump and Russia.

- **Trump aides were in constant touch with senior Russian officials during campaign**.

([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/14/politics/donald-trump-aides-russians-campaign/))

2/ **Andrew Puzder withdraws from consideration as labor secretary**. The Hardee’s/Carl’s Jr. CEO came under intense fire from Democrats and liberal groups who accused him of mistreating his workers, opposing the minimum wage and supporting automation in the workplace. The attacks on his policy views were compounded by intense scrutiny of his personal life, including allegations that he abused his ex-wife in the 1980s. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/us/politics/andrew-puzder-withdrew-labor-secretary.html))

- **Senator Lindsey Graham: Any Trump ally working inappropriately with Russia “needs to pay a price”**. If the reports are true about communication between Trump’s aides and Russia during the campaign, Graham said Congress needs a joint select committee to examine Trump’s business ties to Russia. Trump called recent news stories reporting that his aides had contact with Russian intelligence officials during the 2016 elections “fake news” Wednesday morning and said the “Russian connection non-sense” was an attempt to “cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton’s losing campaign.” ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/lindsey-graham-trump-allies-working-with-russia-235040))

4/ **Jeff Sessions resists pressure to remove himself from his role in investigating Trump’s aides and their relationship with Russia**. Democrats and outside groups say Sessions lacks the independence to oversee criminal investigations that might lead back to the White House. Sessions and Flynn were both early, influential advisers in Trump’s presidential campaign.

5/ **Flynn’s departure erupts into a full-blown crisis for the Trump White House**. The circumstances leading up to Flynn’s departure have quickly become a major crisis for the fledgling administration, forcing the White House on the defensive and precipitating the first significant breach in relations between Trump and an increasingly restive Republican Congress.

8/ **A DREAMer was arrested during a raid** and now a federal magistrate judge has ordered officials to defend the arrest of an undocumented immigrant who has protection from deportation. Attorneys filed a lawsuit accusing federal authorities of unlawfully arresting a Mexican immigrant in Seattle despite him having protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. ([BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/adolfoflores/immigrations-officials-ordered-to-defend-arrest-of-dreamer))

9/ **Trump to welcome Netanyahu for talks that could shape the contours of future Middle East policy**. Palestinians fear the U.S. will abandon its two-state solution for the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Palestine living peacefully alongside Israel has been the bedrock U.S. position for decades. Negotiations broke down in 2014. Under a two-state solution, Israel would end its military occupation of Palestinian areas and allow the Palestinians to form their own self-governing state. ([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-israel-idUSKBN15U0GB))

> UPDATE:

**> Trump said that the U.S. would no longer insist on a Palestinian state**>  as part of a peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians, backing away from a policy that has underpinned America’s role in Middle East peacemaking since the Clinton administration. The comments are a striking departure from two decades of diplomatic orthodoxy. The Palestinians are highly unlikely to accept anything short of a sovereign state.

10/ **Trump skirts tough questions again**. In a joint appearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump only called on reporters from conservative news outlets, or at least outlets likely to be favorable to him. This is now the third bilateral appearance in which Trump appeared to skirt questions about controversial issues by not taking questions from the traditional stable of the press corps. ([CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/15/media/netanyahu-trump-press-conference-questions/index.html))

12/ **Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued an ultimatum to NATO allies**, warning that if they do not boost their defense spending to goals set by the alliance, the United States may alter its relationship with them.

2/ **Trump knew Flynn misled officials on Russia calls for “weeks”** the White House says.

1/ **Michael Flynn resigns as National Security Adviser** after it was revealed that he had misled Pence and other top White House officials about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynn served in the job for less than a month. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/donald-trump-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn.html))

> UPDATE:

**> Flynn on thin ice but still in at the White House after turbulent few days**> . Despite a turbulent 72 hours caused by the national security adviser’s inability to deny that he spoke about sanctions against Russia with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office, Flynn has no plans to resign and no expectations that he will be fired. (> [> CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/13/politics/michael-flynn-donald-trump-white-house/)> )

**> Flynn apologizes after admitting he may have discussed sanctions with Russia**> .

- **Trump remains silent as Flynn falls under growing pressure**. Neither Trump nor his advisers have publicly defended Flynn or stated unequivocally that he has the president’s confidence.

- **Trump responds to North Korean missile launch with uncharacteristic restraint**. Trump read a statement of just 23 words that pledged American support for Tokyo without even mentioning North Korea.

8/ **California governor asks Trump for storm disaster declaration**, as the state grapples with a massive dam spillway glitch in the Sierra foothills. A disaster declaration frees up federal funds to help pay for damage. Presidents usually respond positively to such requests.

Trump also threatened to block federal funds if California goes ahead with plans to become a sanctuary state for immigrants.

That’s not how he’s governing.** The president discussed a national security incident in a public room, with phone flashlights lighting the way. Why is this important? Mobile phones have flashlights — and cameras, microphones and Internet connectivity.

1/ **Reports of raids have immigrants bracing for enforcement surge**. Officials at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, said the immigration roundups did not represent an increased tempo. ICE described it as a routine “targeted enforcement action” in which roughly 160 people were arrested in six counties around Los Angeles. Of those, 150 had criminal histories. The agency has about 100 fugitive teams constantly working to bring in those wanted on a variety of immigration offenses.

3/ **GOP bill would gut EPA**. A House Republican is sponsoring legislation to do away with large portions of the Environmental Protection Agency, including environmental justice and greenhouse gas programs. The Wasteful EPA Programs Elimination Act would save $7.5 billion annually and would leave the EPA with a budget of less than $1 billion. Major EPA climate change programs would be eliminated under the measure. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/318931-gop-bill-would-gut-epa))

4/ **Trump: Refugees are flooding the U.S. and creating a “dangerous” situation** after the judge blocked his travel ban. The percentage of refugees arriving from the so-called seven banned countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — has risen considerably since the directive was suspended. However, the weekly total of refugees arriving from the targeted countries has risen by only about 100. All are stringently vetted.

Several towns, cities and counties around the nation are caving to President Trump’s threat to pull funding, and abandoning their “sanctuary” pledges to shield illegal immigrants from federal authorities. The changes come on the heels of Trump’s executive order giving the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security the power to cut federal funding to communities that are deemed sanctuaries for illegal immigrants.

##   [Day 22:Denials.](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/02/10/Day-22/)

  02/10/2017 *Updated: 03/05/2017 08:07:07 AM PST *

1/ **White House now says it may take travel ban to the Supreme Court**. Minutes after one White House official said Trump would not appeal the 9th Circuit ruling upholding a temporary stay of the travel ban, Reince Priebus said the White House is now “reviewing all of our options in the court system,” including possibly going to the Supreme Court. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/white-house-considers-rewriting-trumps-immigration-order/2017/02/10/ddcf5a6a-efb5-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html))

*Related:*

- Earlier: **When asked if Trump was considering signing a new executive order on immigration: “Nothing’s off the table.”** Trump also has the option of going back to the drawing board and coming up with a new way to impose “extreme vetting” restrictions he says are necessary. But it seems certain he will not take the route since to do so would involve not only admitting the bitter taste of a high stakes legal defeat but repudiating the combative win-at-all-costs attitude that animates his character. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/10/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban-politics/index.html))

2/ **US investigators corroborate some aspects of the Russia dossier** compiled by a former British intelligence agent. None of the newly learned information relates to the salacious allegations in the dossier. The intercepts do confirm that some of the conversations described in the dossier took place between the same individuals on the same days and from the same locations as detailed in the dossier. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/10/politics/russia-dossier-update/index.html))

3/ **Russia considers returning Snowden to U.S. to “curry favor” with Trump**. Trump has called the NSA leaker a “spy” and a “traitor” who deserves to be executed. Russia considers turning over Snowden to be a “gift” to Trump. ([ABC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russia-eyes-sending-snowden-u-s-gift-trump-official-n718921))

4/ **National security adviser Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador, despite denials**. Flynn’s communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were interpreted by some senior U.S. officials as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/national-security-adviser-flynn-discussed-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador-despite-denials-officials-say/2017/02/09/f85b29d6-ee11-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html))

*Related:*

- **Did Mike Pence get burned by Michael Flynn?** Either the national security adviser misled the vice president, or the vice president knowingly misled the American people. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2017/02/10/daily-202-did-mike-pence-get-burned-by-michael-flynn/589d13ffe9b69b1406c75ca2/))

5/ **Trump tells President Xi Jinping U.S. will honor the “One China” Policy**, reversing his earlier expressions of doubt about the longtime diplomatic understanding and removing a major source of tension between the United States and China since shortly after he was elected. Trump had to publicly commit to upholding the 44-year-old policy for President Xi to take his call. The concession was clearly designed to put an end to an extended chill in the relationship between China and the United States. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/world/asia/donald-trump-china-xi-jinping-letter.html))

- **The US’s One-China policy explained**: It has been the policy of the United States to recognize Taiwan as part of China. The one-China policy is the delicate balance between respecting China’s claim to the territory and maintaining close ties to Taiwan. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/uss-china-policy-explained/story?id=43983884))

- **Trump’s retreat over Taiwan and China’s currency may be tactical**. Trump has threatened to label China a currency manipulator and to slap tariffs of as much as 45% on Chinese goods. If he follows through with that, the result could be a trade war that damages both economies. But, talking with China, rather than trading threats, could help Trump come away with some kind of deal on issues like import tariffs and currencies that he could tout as a victory. ([CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/10/news/economy/trump-china-taiwan-threats-trade/index.html))

6/ **Jared Kushner proves to be a shadow diplomat on U.S.-Mexico talks**. Kushner’s back-channel communications with Mexico reveals he’s operating like a shadow secretary of state, operating outside the boundaries of the State Department or National Security Council. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jared-kushner-a-shadow-diplomat-pulls-the-strings-on-us-mexico-talks/2017/02/09/aed2cf80-ef0b-11e6-9973-c5efb7ccfb0d_story.html))

7/ **Tom Price confirmed as the new secretary of Health and Human Services**. He was approved by a party-line vote of 52-47. Democrats were concerned that the conservative congressman wants to pare down government health programs. They were also troubled by lingering ethics questions over Price’s investments. ([NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/10/514365195/tom-price-confirmed-as-secretary-of-health-and-human-services))

*Related:*

- **12.2 million people have signed up for Obamacare this year**, even with the uncertainty created by Trump’s vow to repeal and replace it. Enrollment is about 4 percent lower than last year, the sizable number of sign-ups illustrates the risk Republicans face as they begin moving to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and put in its place a yet-to-be-defined conservative approach.

9/ **Trump border wall to cost $21.6 billion and take 3.5 years to build**, based on a U.S. Department of Homeland Security internal report. The report’s estimated price-tag is much higher than a $12-billion figure cited by Trump in his campaign. ([Reuters](http://in.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-immigration-wall-idINKBN15O2ZZ))

10/ **Treasury nominee vows no tax cut for rich. But the math says the opposite.** Mnuchin said any rate reductions at the top would be offset by the closing of fat loopholes, his guarantee appears impossible to fulfill either under the tax overhaul that the House Republicans are pushing or similar, sketchier proposals that Mr. Trump has offered. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/business/economy/mnuchin-rule-tax-cut.html))

11/ **Trump vexed by challenges, scale of government**. The president’s allies say he has been surprised that government can’t be run like his business. Nearly two dozen people who’ve spent time with Trump in the three weeks since his inauguration said that his mood has careened between surprise and anger as he’s faced the predictable realities of governing, from congressional delays over his cabinet nominations and legal fights holding up his aggressive initiatives to staff in-fighting and leaks. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/donald-trump-challenges-governing-presidency-234879))

12/ **Republicans push bill to split up “nutty 9th Circuit”**. They argue that the 9th is too big, too liberal and too slow resolving cases. If they succeed, only California, Oregon, Hawaii and two island districts would remain in the 9th’s judicial fiefdom. Nevada, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Arizona, and Alaska would be part of the brand new 12th Circuit. ([Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/09/bill-to-split-nutty-9th-circuit-gains-momentum.html))

13/ **A blueprint for resistance to Trump has emerged. Here’s what it looks like:** faith in the system, pressure Republicans to exercise oversight, use all the procedural tools in the Senate, leverage civil society, keep Trump distracted.

  02/09/2017 *Updated: 03/05/2017 08:07:07 AM PST *

1/ **The 9th Circuit Court refused to reinstate travel ban**, delivering the latest and most stinging judicial rebuke to Trump’s effort to tighten the standards for entry into the United States and make good on a campaign promise. The ruling was focused on the narrow question of whether the travel ban should be blocked while courts consider its lawfulness. The decision is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.

2/ **Conway may have broken key ethics rule by touting Ivanka Trump’s products**.

*Related:*

- **Trump’s defense of Ivanka reflects approach that could hurt the economy**. The prospect of a costly Trump tantrum could give factory bosses reason to think twice before setting up shop in the United States. In the short run, perhaps Trump’s threats can slow a painful decline. But in the longer run, defending the status quo may do more harm than good.

4/ **Sessions sworn in as attorney general while Trump signed three executive actions aimed at bolstering law enforcement.** Sessions pledged to attack a crime problem that he described as “a dangerous permanent trend that has places the health and safety of the American people at risk.” Although murder jumped by 11% in 2015, the biggest one-year increase in more than 40 years, the overall rate remains the lowest in decades.

5/ **Trump attacks McCain for questioning success of deadly Yemen raid**. McCain initially referred to the raid as “a failure” but later dialed back his criticism, saying that some objectives were fulfilled in the mission but that he would “not describe any operation that results in the loss of American life as a success.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/09/trump-attacks-mccain-for-questioning-success-of-deadly-yemen-raid/))

6/ **Republican Senator admits GOP health-care plan has to remain secret because it will be unpopular**. Senator Mike Lee insists that Republicans repeal Obamacare first, before they decide on an alternative. And his reason is straightforward: If people saw the Republican alternative, they might not like it! ([New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/02/republican-admits-why-gop-health-plan-must-remain-secret.html))

  02/08/2017 *Updated: 03/05/2017 08:07:07 AM PST *

1/ **Jeff Sessions confirmed as Attorney General**, capping a bitter and racially charged nomination battle. Sessions survived a near-party-line vote, 52 to 47, in the latest sign of the extreme partisanship at play as Trump strains to install his cabinet. No Republicans broke ranks in their support.

- **How senators voted on Sessions**. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/02/08/us/politics/jeff-sessions-confirmation-vote.html))

- **Why Jeff Sessions is so uniquely dangerous**. Sessions will not prioritize citizens who have had their lives ruined by racial disparities in policing, or by the persistent use of excessive force by officers who are shielded from accountability. He won’t be an attorney general who will side with those consigned by petty judges to cycles of poverty and crime, or those circulating in and out of a new generation of debtors’ prisons. ([Esquire](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a52895/who-is-jeff-sessions-attorney-general/))

2/ **Republicans vote to rebuke Elizabeth Warren for impugning Sessions’s character**.

4/ **House Republicans voted to eliminate the only federal agency that makes sure voting machines can’t be hacked**.

([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-sheriff-asset-forfeiture-texas-234740))

8/ **US military to rent space in Trump Tower**. Military support for a president, including the military staff assigned to keeping the “nuclear football” nearby, requires close proximity to the commander in chief, which is why the Pentagon needs to rent a more expensive space closer to the penthouse where Trump resides when he’s in New York. The floors available to rent cost about $1.5 million a year. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/politics/military-to-rent-space-trump-tower/index.html))

1/ **Trump Picks Neil Gorsuch, A Scalia Clone, For The Supreme Court.** Ideologically, Gorsuch would almost certainly represent a reliably conservative vote and voice. Gorsuch would be the most conservative justice save for the silent stalwart Justice Clarence Thomas and would sit somewhere just to the right of the ideological space occupied by Scalia.

([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/317035-sessions-approved-by-senate-committee))

1/ **Hill staffers secretly worked on Trump’s immigration order.** Several House Judiciary Committee aides helped craft the controversial directive without telling Republican leaders.

4/ **Donald Trump, the refugee ban, and the triumph of cruelty.** The reasons for Trump’s ban on refugees could not be more feeble, and could not be more petty. It serves no actual security purpose. You have a better chance of getting killed by a train, or by your own clothes catching on fire, than by an immigrant terrorist attack. The odds of a refugee killing you in a terrorist strike are about 1 in 3.6 billion. That’s about four hundred times less likely than being hit by lightning twice. If you look back at significant terrorist attacks in the US like San Bernardino or the Pulse nightclub shooting or 9/11, exactly none of them would have been prevented by this policy.

  01/28/2017 *Updated: 03/05/2017 08:07:07 AM PST *

1/ **Trump’s order blocks immigrants at airports, stoking fear around the globe.** The executive order suspended entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely, and blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security said that the executive order also barred green card holders from those countries from re-entering the United States. White House officials said that green card holders from the seven affected countries who are outside the United States would need a case-by-case waiver to return to the United States.

But it stopped short of letting them into the country or issuing a broader ruling on the constitutionality of Trump’s actions.

Meanwhile…

I bet, Paul Ryan.

2/ **A federal judge issued a stay against Donald Trump’s “Muslim Ban”.** The ruling – a stunning defeat for Trump at the end of his first week in office – protects from deportation refugees or visa holders who were detained at American airports since the signing of so-called “Muslim ban.” It also protects those in transit when the emergency ruling was filed.

4/ **Inside the confusion of the Trump executive order and travel ban.** Administration officials weren’t immediately sure which countries’ citizens would be barred from entering the United States.

7/ **‘Up Is Down’: Trump’s unreality show echoes his business past.** Trump’s falsehoods have long been viewed as a reflexive extension of his vanity, or as his method of compensating for deep-seated insecurities. But throughout his business career, Trump’s most noteworthy deceptions often did double duty, serving not just his ego but also important strategic goals. Mr. Trump’s habitually inflated claims about his wealth, for example, fed his self-proclaimed image of a business genius even as they attracted lucrative licensing deals built around the Trump brand.

1/ **Trump executive order suspends admission of all refugees for 120 days** while a new system is put in place to tighten vetting for those from predominantly Muslim countries and give preference to religious minorities. Trump said that the goal is to screen out “radical Islamic terrorists” and that priority for admission would be given to Christians. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-approves-extreme-vetting-of-refugees-promises-priority-for-christians/2017/01/27/007021a2-e4c7-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html))

2/ **The extreme vetting plan to establishes a religious test** for refugees from Muslim nations. The order also stops the admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely, and bars entry into the United States for 90 days from seven predominantly Muslim countries linked to concerns about terrorism. Those countries are Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. ([NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/trump-syrian-refugees.html))

3/ **The order will block 500,000 legal U.S. residents from returning to American from trips abroad.** The president has also used language that will affect those who are in the U.S. already on visas and green cards. ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america/))

4/ **Trump’s immigration ban excludes countries with business ties.** His proposed list doesn’t include Muslim-majority countries where his Trump Organization has done business or pursued potential deals. Properties include golf courses in the United Arab Emirates and two luxury towers operating in Turkey. ([Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-trump-immigration-ban-conflict-of-interest/))

5/ **Trump’s immigration ban is illegal.** More than 50 years ago, Congress outlawed such discrimination against immigrants based on national origin. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/opinion/trumps-immigration-ban-is-illegal.html))

6/ **Following Trump’s executive order green card, visa holders already blocked by airports.** Within hours of the executive order limiting immigration from Muslim countries, green card and visa holders were already being blocked from getting on flights to the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security issued a directive at 4:30 p.m. ordering the Customs and Border Protection to enforce the executive order. People who were still in the air as of 10:30 p.m. likely face being blocked at the airport when their planes land, he said. ([NY Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-order-blocks-green-card-visa-holders-airports-article-1.2957910))

7/ **A little-noticed move by Trump could make it easier to deport immigrants.** The move stripped federal privacy protections from many immigrants, raising fears among advocacy groups that information people willingly submitted to the federal government during the Obama administration could now be used to help deport them. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-little-noticed-move-by-trump-could-make-it-easier-to-deport-immigrants/2017/01/27/fd5734ec-e4cb-11e6-a453-19ec4b3d09ba_story.html))

8/ **Governing without a script.** Trumps seems to be running his administration much like he ran his company and campaign, eager to weigh in on every issue and willing to make last-minute calls. ([Wall Stree Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-first-week-governing-without-a-script-1485544924))

9/ **Trump blows up the U.S.-Mexico relationship.** In one of his first instances of Twitter diplomacy as President, Trump wrote, “If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.” Not surprisingly, Peña Nieto cancelled.

10/ **The theater of access.** Trump’s relationship with the media may be obsessive, but it’s also deeply transactional — the media has always been a tool in his pursuit of fame and power. ([NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/magazine/donald-trump-and-the-theater-of-access.html))

11/ **The Bannon coup.** White House and Hill GOP leaders are astonished by the unambiguous, far-reaching power of Steve Bannon and policy guru Stephen Miller over, well, just about everything.([Axios](http://www.axios.com/the-bannon-coup-2218491076.html))

12/ **Trump’s first seven days in office were historic, chaotic, astonishing and unsettling.** With a flurry of provocative executive orders, surreal events, unapologetic falsehoods and did-he-really-say-that tweets, Trump continued to obliterate political norms, serving notice that the gaze of history won’t change who he is. He made so much news and did so many unorthodox things that it was hard to keep track of everything that was changing in Washington. The question, though, is what did all that sound and fury signify? ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/president-trump-week-one-first-administration-214699))

13/ **Republican lawmakers fret about how to repeal Obamacare.** Republican lawmakers aired sharp concerns about their party’s quick push to repeal the Affordable Care Act inside a closed-door meeting Thursday, according to a recording of the session obtained by The Washington Post.

14/ **Pence vows “full evaluation of voting rolls” over claims of fraud.** In a private meeting with congressional Republicans this week, the Trump administration would pursue a wide-ranging probe of voting rolls in the United States to examine whether millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election as President Trump has charged.

16/ **Trump backers like his first draft of a New America.** Trump voters interviewed said they cared little if the president spouted off on Twitter because he was issuing the kind of executive actions many had long craved — freezing federal grant money for environmental research, banning foreign aid for groups that give abortion counseling and cutting off immigration from several Muslim-majority nations.

  01/26/2017 *Updated: 03/05/2017 08:07:07 AM PST *

1/ **Steve Bannon says media should “keep its mouth shut.”** Trump’s chief strategist, laced into the American press during an interview, arguing that news organizations had been “humiliated” by an election outcome few anticipated, and repeatedly describing the media as “the opposition party” of the current administration. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/business/media/stephen-bannon-trump-news-media.html))

2/ **One of the greatest threats Trump poses is that he corrupts and corrodes the absoluteness of truth, facts and science.** It is no coincidence that the rise of Trump is concurrent with the rise of “fake news.” It is no coincidence that his rise comes during an age of severely damaged faith in institutions. Our president is a pathological liar. Say it. Write it. Never become inured to it. And dispense with the terms of art to describe it. A lie by any other name portends the same. ([NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/opinion/a-lie-by-any-other-name.html))

3/ **Fake news is about to get even scarier than you ever dreamed.** What we saw in the 2016 election is nothing compared to what we need to prepare for in 2020. If there’s one thing we learned from this election cycle, it is that there are a number of reasons that people create fake-news stories. And, it has become clear that most new consumers don’t want to know if what they are reading is real or fake; they just want to know that it helps support their worldview. ([Vanity Fair](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/fake-news-technology))

4/ **The State Department’s entire senior management team resigned.** Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s job running the State Department just got considerably more difficult. The entire senior level of management officials resigned as part of an ongoing mass exodus of senior Foreign Service officers who don’t want to stick around for the Trump era. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2017/01/26/the-state-departments-entire-senior-management-team-just-resigned/))

7/ **(The cost of) Trump’s wall keeps getting higher and higher.** Republican Congressional leaders signaled plans to move forward with Trump’s planned border wall, estimated to cost between $12 billion and $15 billion. That’s well below many outside estimates of the construction cost (let alone maintenance), but is significantly higher than what Trump himself has said in the past. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/the-cost-of-trumps-wall-keepss-getting-higher-and-higher-2216737417.html))

8/ **Americans think Trump will be worst president since Nixon.** Voters are so dim on Trump that they think, in the first week of his administration, that he will prove to be a worse President than everyone who’s held the office since Richard Nixon.

  01/25/2017 *Updated: 03/05/2017 08:07:07 AM PST *

1/ **Trump’s voter fraud example?** A troubled tale about Bernhard Langer meant to illustrate rampant, unchecked voter fraud. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/trump-bernhard-langer-voting-fraud.html))

>

**> tl;dr**>  Langer was standing in line at a polling place on Election Day. Ahead of and behind Langer were voters who “did not look as if they should be allowed to vote.” Langer left feeling frustrated. *> Here’s the problem:*>  Langer, who lives in Boca Raton, Fla., is a German citizen with permanent residence status in the United States who is, by law, barred from voting.

2/ **Declining trust in government is denting democracy.** America, which has long defined itself as a standard-bearer of democracy for the world, has become a “flawed democracy” according to the taxonomy used in the annual Democracy Index from the Economist Intelligence Unit. Although its score did not fall by much – from 8.05 in 2015 to 7.98 in 2016 – it was enough for it to slip just below the 8.00 threshold for a “full democracy”. ([The Economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/01/daily-chart-20))

3/ **Trump’s impulses now carry the force of the presidency.** Impetuous and instinctive, convinced of broad, but hidden plots to undermine him, eager to fight and prone to what an aide called “alternative facts,” Trump has shown in just days in office that he is like few if any occupants of the White House before him. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/donald-trump-presidency.html))

4/ **Those flashy executive actions could run aground.** The White House failed to consult with many of the agencies and lawmakers who will be critical for their success. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trumps-flashy-executive-actions-could-run-aground-234200))

2/ **Trump orders the construction of a Mexican border wall.** It’s the first in a series of actions to curtail immigration and bolster national security. It includes slashing the number of refugees who can resettle in the United States and blocks Syrians and others from “terror prone” nations from entering temporarily. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/us/politics/wall-border-trump.html))

3/ **Federal works told to stop talking to Congress and the press.** The freeze has startled aides on the Hill and people at those agencies, who worry that it could abruptly upend current operations and stifle work and discussions that routinely take place between branches of government. ([Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-communication-freeze_us_58878b3ae4b0441a8f7114e2))

4/ **Trump has imposed a freeze on grants and contracts by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.** ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-administration-imposes-freeze-on-epa-grants-and-contracts)) Trump also banned employees from giving social media updates and speaking with reporters.

UPDATE: The order was rescinded by the department on Tuesday. ([Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/legacy_mobile/dinograndoni/trump-usda))

> “…at some point, the disposition should be he is going to do it unless we can prove otherwise. He has shown through every step of the way that he’s going to win. And so it just seems to me it’s just odd that if those are the odds, if you are looking at his track record, the track record is a proven track record of success and winning. And yet, the media’s default is on every scenario, whether it’s hasn’t nominees getting through or winning a primary or him accomplishing something, it’s immediately negative and a failure.” (> [> Media Matters](https://mediamatters.org/video/2017/01/24/trump-press-secretary-media-disposition-should-be-trump-correct-unless-we-can-prove-otherwise/215116)> )

10/ **Trump dogged by insecurity over popular vote, media coverage.** He might hold the most powerful office in the world, but he’s dogged by insecurity over his loss of the popular vote in the election and a persistent frustration that the legitimacy of his presidency is being challenged by Democrats and the media, aides and associates say. ([Associated Press](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/61415760238042f2ad7bc38acc2f468c/trumps-bridge-building-eclipsed-false-voter-fraud-claim))

11/ **For Trump, everything is a rating.** Trump spent his first weekend in office at war with math. He said that his inauguration crowd — which photographs showed was dwarfed by Barack Obama’s estimated 1.8 million in 2009 — “looked like a million, a million and a half.” His staff members backed up that claim with what his adviser Kellyanne Conway memorably termed “alternative facts.” ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/arts/television/for-trump-everything-is-a-rating.html))

12/ **Trump 101: What he reads and watches.**
>

> With an allergy to computers and phones, he works the papers. With a black Sharpie in hand, he marks up the Times or other printed stories. When he wants action or response, he scrawls the staffers’ names on that paper and either hands the clip to them in person, or has a staffer create a PDF of it — with handwritten commentary — and email it to them. An amazed senior adviser recently pulled out his phone to show us a string of the emailed PDFs, all demanding response. It was like something from the early 90s. Even when he gets worked up enough to tweet, Trump told us in our interview he will often simply dictate it, and let his staff hit “send” on Twitter.

2/ **Spicer: ‘Negative’ Trump coverage is ‘demoralizing’** The White House press secretary pushed back at what he said was negative coverage of the Trump White House, describing the media narrative as “demoralizing. It’s not just about a crowd size. There’s this constant theme to undercut the enormous support he has,” Spicer said of Trump. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/315721-spicer-negative-trump-coverage-is-demoralizing))

3/ **No White House leaks like this… until now.** The Trump White House not only leaks like crazy. It casually leaks the most intimate and humiliating details about the President - hurt feelings, ego injury, childlike behavior, self-destructive rages over tweets, media failure to credit his own grandiosity. We have simply never seen this level of leaking, with this little respect for the President’s dignity or reputation, this early. ([Talking Points Memo](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/no-white-house-leaks-like-this-until-now))

4/ **Without evidence, Trump tells lawmakers 3 million to 5 million illegal ballots cost him the popular vote.** Days after being sworn in, President Trump insisted to congressional leaders invited to a reception at the White House that he would have won the popular vote had it not been for millions of illegal votes, according to people familiar with the meeting. Trump has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that widespread voter fraud caused him to lose the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, even while he clinched the presidency with an electoral college victory.

5/ **Why Trump’s staff is lying.** One of the most striking features of the early Trump administration has been its political uses of lying. The big weekend story was the obviously false claim that Trump pulled in the largest inauguration crowds in American history. This raises the question of why a leader might find it advantageous to promote such lies from his subordinates. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-01-23/why-trump-s-staff-is-lying))

6/ **The costs of Trump-branded reality: America’s credibility.** When Trump swore the presidential oath, he assumed responsibility not only for the levers of government but also for one of the United States’ most valuable assets, battered though it may be: its credibility. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/business/media/alternative-facts-trump-brand.html))

7/ **Meanwhile, Trump’s top aides are troubled by his rocky first weekend in office**, unfolded much the way things often did during his campaign: with angry Twitter messages, a familiar obsession with slights and a series of meandering and at times untrue statements, all eventually giving way to attempts at damage control. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/donald-trump-aides-rocky-first-weekend.html))

8/ **WikiLeaks calls out Trump for refusing to release tax returns.** ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/wikileaks-trump-tax-return-234000))

1/ **Photos comparing Trump’s inauguration crowd to the Women’s March** ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/21/politics/womens-march-donald-trump-inauguration-sizes/index.html))

2/ **White House press secretary Sean Spicer attacked media for accurately reporting inauguration crowds.** “This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period,” Spicer said, contradicting all available data. Aerial photos have indicated that former president Barack Obama’s first inauguration attracted a much larger crowd. Nielsen ratings show that Obama also had a bigger television audience. Spicer, at times almost yelling while reading a prepared statement, took no questions. ([CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/21/media/sean-spicer-press-secretary-statement/index.html))

3/ **Trump used his first full day in office on Saturday to unleash a remarkably bitter attack on the news media**, falsely accusing journalists of both inventing a rift between him and intelligence agencies and deliberately understating the size of his inauguration crowd. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/politics/trump-white-house-briefing-inauguration-crowd-size.html))

4/ **Trump says he has “running war” with media, criticizes the “dishonest media,” gets facts wrong, in CIA speech.** ([CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/21/media/donald-trump-war-with-the-media/))

5/ At CIA headquarters, Trump denies feud, lashed out at critics, boasted of his magazine covers, and **exaggerated the size of the crowd at his inauguration.** ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-cia-langley-233971))

6/ **Trump’s real war isn’t with the media. It’s with facts.** He needs to delegitimize the media because he needs to delegitimize facts. ([Vox](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/21/14347952/trump-spicer-press-conference-crowd-size-inauguration))

2/ Trump boasted his inauguration would have an “unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout.” **But aerial shots of the National Mall from Obama’s 2009 inauguration and today show that isn’t likely.** ([Vox](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/20/14332462/photos-crowd-trump-inauguration-vs-obama))

3/ **All references to climate change have been deleted** from the White House website.

We spoke to officials in each of those states. ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-promised-to-resign-from-his-companies-but-no-record-hes-done-so))
