This is a guide to teaching a series of lessons to pupils from Year 7 upwards. The materials have been tried and tested with classes and evaluated by a number of teachers including non-specialists and Python developers.

The lessons start with no previous experience of Python and then build up to creating a text-based game with some basic artificial intelligence. A second unit is currently being developed to follow on, for teaching from Year 8 with progression.

For some background, read my blogpost about [teaching Python to Year 7](https://teachcomputing.wordpress.com/2011/12/01/teach-programming-language-to-11-year-olds/) and this one about [Year 8 programming with Python](https://teachcomputing.wordpress.com/2011/11/25/year-8s-programming-with-python/).
