#  100 announcements (!) from Google Cloud Next '17

 Alison Wagonfeld
 VP of Marketing,   Google Cloud

San Francisco — What a week! [Google Cloud Next ‘17](https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/) has come to the end, but really, it’s just the beginning. We welcomed 10,000+ attendees including customers, partners, developers, IT leaders, engineers, press, analysts, cloud enthusiasts (and skeptics). Together we engaged in 3 days of keynotes, 200+ sessions, and 4 invitation-only summits. Hard to believe this was our first show as all of Google Cloud with GCP, G Suite, Chrome, Maps and Education. Thank you to all who were here with us in San Francisco this week, and we hope to see you next year.

If you’re a fan of video highlights, we’ve got you covered. Check out our [Day 1 keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9VCYgSxlQ)(in less than 4 minutes) and [Day 2 keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvYmHNwutx0&feature=youtu.be) (in under 5!).

One of the common refrains from customers and partners throughout the conference was “Wow, you’ve been busy. I can’t believe how many announcements you’ve had at Next!” So we decided to count all the announcements from across Google Cloud and in fact we had 100 (!) announcements this week.

For the list lovers amongst you, we’ve compiled a handy-dandy run-down of our announcements from the past few days:
