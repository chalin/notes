By 2018, the United States alone could face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions.

What sort of personality makes for an effective data scientist? Definitely curiosity…. **The biggest question in data science is ‘Why?’** Why is this happening? If you notice that there’s a pattern, ask, ‘Why?’ Is there something wrong with the data or is this an actual pattern going on? Can we conclude anything from this pattern? A natural curiosity will definitely give you a good foundation.

There’s a digital revolution taking place both in and out of government in favor of open-sourced data, innovation, and collaboration.
