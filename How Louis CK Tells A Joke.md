MY RULES FOR SPONSORSHIPS:
1) Sponsor cannot choose video topic.
2) Sponsor cannot give notes or ask for changes.
3) Sponsor cannot see video before it airs.

4) Sponsorship will not be integrated into the video proper in any way, but only appear on the end-screen after a few seconds of black.

5) I have to be sympathetic with the brand/client.
