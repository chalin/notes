| Welcome!<br>If you're new to Radio Paradise, welcome! We're very glad you found us.<br>RP is a blend of many styles and genres of music, carefully selected and mixed by two real human beings. You'll hear modern and classic rock, world music, electronica, even a bit of classical and jazz. What you won't hear are random computer-generated playlists or mind-numbing commercials.<br>Our specialty is taking a diverse assortment of songs and making them flow together in a way that makes sense harmonically, rhythmically, and lyrically — an art that, to us, is the very essence of radio. We hope that you'll enjoy RP so much that you'll want to [**become a supporter**](https://www.radioparadise.com/rp2s-content.php?name=Support) and to share us with your friends, your family, your co-workers, your neighbors... you get the idea. ;~)<br>Your grateful hosts, [**Bill & Rebecca Goldsmith**](http://www.radioparadise.com/?name=About)<br>RP Shirts & Stuff<br>[![](../_resources/32462a2e65b6b68d916bf4ffd7d11564.png)](https://www.cafepress.com/radioparadise)<br>Our online emporium features many styles of shirts, hoodies, cups, hats, buttons, stickers and all sorts of other goodies — all carefully branded to help you show of your excellent taste in radio stations.

Just go to the App Store and [download our current app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/radio-paradise-2.0/id517818306?mt=8&uo=4) (still free). That should solve the problem — and give you access to several nifty new features: the ability to skip songs, several PSD (Play Something Different) options, and the ability to cache blocks of RP programming on your phone for offline playback.<br>We're very sorry for any confusion.<br>Thanks for your Support!<br>If you're already a regular RP supporter, thank you very much. A special thanks to those of you who've become first-time supporters in response to our recent support requests.<br>If not, this would be a [great time to start](https://www.radioparadise.com/support). A 2016 royalty board ruling increased the fees that we pay for the use of music by over 300%. This has been quite a challenge for us.<br>We're happy to provide RP free of charge to everyone, including those of you who aren't able to send support. However, if you can afford to [become a supporter](https://www.radioparadise.com/support) — either on a one-time or an ongoing basis — we would appreciate it now more than ever.<br>The artists we play will benefit from your support as well, as at least 50% of the royalties we pay go directly to them rather than to their record labels. You can [read more about the royalty issue here](https://www.radioparadise.com/rp2s-content.php?name=Support&file=crb).<br>We've also been investing in some very interesting upgrades to the RP listening experience. Some of those are available now, and more are on their way soon. See below for more about that.<br>"Alexa, play Radio Paradise"<br>If you have an Amazon Echo or other Alexa-enabled device, just say "Alexa, enable Radio Paradise" to start using our Alexa skill.<br>Once it's enabled, tell her "Alexa, play Radio Paradise" to start listening, then "Alexa, skip" if you don't care for what's playing — or "Alexa, ask Radio Paradise what's playing".<br>When you enable the skill, check the Alexa app to link your RP account & see a list of all of the available commands.<br>New improved web player & site design on the way<br>We've been hard at work on a web player that allows you to skip songs — like you can with our apps — rather than use the current "PSD" (Play Something Different) function. If all goes well, that will be available sometime later this month — along with some very nice enhancements and updates to our website design.<br>Some of the new features are available on our [beta website](https://beta.radioparadise.com/), along with some more information about the coming changes.
