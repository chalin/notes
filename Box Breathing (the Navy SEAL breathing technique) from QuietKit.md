This Navy SEAL breathing technique, aka box breathing or tactical breathing, is used to calm yourself down, a simple 4 second rotation of breathing in, holding, breathing out, holding.

A perfect visual meditation for when you can't listen to audio, or just need a quick second to refocus.

Use this image to help you keep time! :)

**Here are the directions**:
1. Inhale for 4 seconds (as the circle expands)
2. Hold your lungs full for 4 seconds (as the circle stays fully expanded)
3. Exhale for 4 seconds (as the circle shrinks)
4. Hold your lungs empty for 4 seconds (as the circle is contracted)

That's it!
Repeat for as many times as you need to calm down.
