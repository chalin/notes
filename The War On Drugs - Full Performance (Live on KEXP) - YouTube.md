   I was there at the KEXP studio's with my gf who brought me there by surprise - coming from Europe - hoping we would be in time to see them play, when we realized it was already full. I must've mumbled about it how bummed I was to have missed my favourite band play live in their studio, when this super nice guy just came up to me and said "here's my ticket", and i'm like "what?". "Yeah they're not my favourite anyway". Ended up seeing them for the first time ever. One of the best bands there is.
