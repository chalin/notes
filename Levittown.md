My great uncles returned to Brooklyn after military service in World War II and quickly discovered American cities were in a terrible state of disrepair. No one had money for maintenance in the decade long Great Depression of the 1930s. The war years of the 1940s saw rationing and shortages of every kind including a tremendous lack of housing. There were ten siblings in my grandmother’s generation and the men, being typical New York Sicilians, went in to the building trades. Among their numerous employers were Abraham, William, and Alfred Levitt of [Levitt & Sons.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levitt_%26_Sons)

The Levitts were to post war housing what Henry Ford was to automobiles. They pioneered mass production, standardization, economies of scale, and innovative financing. At the peak of production new [Levittown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levittown) homes were being finished at the rate of one every sixteen minutes. And the Levitts built a *lot* of these homes all over the country. They grew rich while providing genuinely affordable housing people actually wanted. People of my grandparent’s generation grabbed hold of these homes with both hands and couldn’t imagine returning to the city which continued to decline.

This was only made possible by enormous federal subsidies for returning soldiers and huge investments in public infrastructure by the federal government. The private sector and the government were in alignment when it came to solving big national problems for mutual benefit. Ironically it was Big Business and Big Government that created the environment for individuals to achieve their dreams of an independent and secure home life.

Built in 1952, these particular homes are now sixty seven years old. Some of the Levittown homes have been modified and upgraded over the decades. Others limp along fair to middling.

As these homes age so do the pipes, pavement, and other infrastructure that keeps the community functioning. The associated sewerage treatment plants, water supply systems, landfills, power stations, and schools are all aging out. Replacing them is an expensive endeavor. And that doesn’t include the accumulated pension obligations for teachers, police, fire fighters and administrators. The money simply isn’t there beyond a certain date.

The commercial strips that served the Levittown population well for an entire lifetime are now played out. The Levittown [Shop-O-Rama](http://statemuseumpa.org/levittown/two/m.html) was eclipsed when the Oxford Valley Mall opened in 1973.  It’s been a long slow ride down ever since in spite of multiple attempts at retail retrofits. The department stores of the Eisenhower and Kennedy era are long gone, replaced by the Dollar Store.

Meanwhile the Oxford Valley Mall is half empty and on life support with nurses eyeing the bedside plug. Venerable stores like Sears have gone the way of the buggy whip after a century. The once mighty Macy’s empire is circling the drain. Without anchor stores malls are just giant concrete boxes with florescent lighting.

And there it is. The dreaded wig shop. Flagship of retail desperation and harbinger of doom. Next stop, evangelical day care centers and government offices to fill the void.

An attempt was made to create a professional office center to compliment the mall. Perhaps it worked once some decades ago. Now it’s killing time waiting for yet another round of redevelopment. The trouble is there are hundreds of such failing malls everywhere in a massively overbuilt retail environment. A few are attracting upscale tenants and new construction. But most simply don’t have a population with sufficient income to support much beyond what’s already here. Everything has a beginning, a middle, and an end.

This is what passes for a transit hub in the Levittown area. Desperate people standing out in the open next to a dead mall waiting for a bus to somewhere that’s probably equally bleak. The buses only exist because the federal government mandates them as a condition of continued highway funding. It’s pointless.

Levittown served two or three generations very well and that should be celebrated. But Levittown has various trajectories it could follow from here on out. It can hold on tight to what’s there now and keep up appearances for a while longer. Fudge the numbers, kick the can down the road, extend and pretend. That can go on until the underground utilities and pavement fail entirely due to lack of sufficient tax base to maintain them. Flint, Michigan. Ferguson, Missouri. They arrived at their destinations first not as anomalies, but pioneers to a new reality. Or Levittown could rebalance its tax revenue with its obligations with some combination of infill development and/or re-ruralization. Time will tell.

I'm an amateur architecture buff with a passionate interest in where and how we all live and occupy the landscape, from small rural towns to skyscrapers and everything in between. I travel often, conduct interviews with people of interest, and gather photos and video of places worth talking about. The good, the bad, and the ugly - it's all fascinating to me.[View all posts by Johnny](https://granolashotgun.com/author/jdsfrisco/)

A rather evocative piece for me. For twelve years, until the fall of 2105, I lived in Bensalem, located about five miles from Levittown.

I used to occasionally go shopping at Oxford Valley Mall and share your concerns about its future. As well as the seemingly remorseless march to online retailing, Oxford Valley faces competition from several other malls nearby. Southwest, towards Philadelphia, there’s Neshaminy Mall and Philadelphia Mills; while the other way, over the state line in New Jersey, is Quaker Bridge Mall; further west is the mega mall at King of Prussia, while there are innumerable strip malls nearby. Whatever else northeast Philadelphia lacks, it is not retail space!

By contrast, I think the future of Levittown is quite bright, as it offers attractive and, crucially, reasonably-priced housing in an economically-buoyant area. Again, to the southwest is Philadelphia and to the northeast is southern New Jersey, both of which seem to be doing well. (When I lived in the area, I was able to work pretty steadily.) OK, the houses and related infrastructure are getting old, but they’re only about seventy years, while there are plenty of older places which are doing fine. I’m sure any problems are ultimately fixable.

All that vacant retail space and empty office space means lack of jobs, right? But all the needed maintenance means a glut of jobs. Maybe part of the narrative about a place like this is the people living there ought to be able to provide enough workers to fix it up. If they can’t, either they aren’t learning enough of h the right skills, or their labor is being sucked away somewhere else… Perhaps we’re too caught up in the idea it takes specialists to do the work.

Maybe we really just need more men like your Uncles who saw work needing done and took jobs doing it?

There’s enough jobs for Levittown. The retail and office space is empty because the US has far too much of both, further exacerbated by the move to big box and online retail, and to open offices. Older buildings get the worst of that because they are less “cool” and not as well designed for current office layouts and equipment. They sit empty partly due to speculation and partly because zoning codes don’t allow it to be redeveloped as residential (and partly because investors are speculating that the zoning codes will become more sensible…)

This reminds me of Santa Rosa. Same story with the mall and so many strip malls and public spaces which are becoming haunts of dope fiends who migrate along the “Free and Easy” (101-5-405). The pension obligations are doubling by 2022. The roads are rubble and as you predicted, half the houses won’t be rebuilt. Weeeeeee!!!!!

In my metro (Cleveland OH) the clear analog is Parma, OH.

It’s effectively a first ring suburb that was mostly platted during the 1920s ‘plat the countryside’ boom, then sat fallow until the late 1940s and into the 1950s, when people that owned many many of these 50’x125′ lots began building cape cods as far as the already platted land would allow. Then the eventual second and third generation movement begins again further south to Strongsville, Brunswick to now, the semi-rural Townships in Medina County, OH (my county).

Well, now you can get these nicely maintained centrally located cape cods in Parma for low per sqft prices as long as you’re ok with the minimal infrastructure maintenance and, effectively, underfunded local public school district.

When you move the deck chairs around on the Titanic, some part is going to lose.

I find these early post-WW2 neighborhoods really hard to make generalizations about, even though they were stamped out almost identically across the country. For one, there’s just distance. In a city like Chicago, these neighborhoods are 10-15 miles outside of the loop versus in a city like Milwaukee where they are about 3-8 miles outside of downtown. So in Milwaukee, a lot of these neighborhoods are still relatively quick times to downtown, great to bike around. It’s a $10-20 uber to much of the city. And these neighborhoods seem to get better as their adjacent inner neighborhoods intensify, improve their main streets, become better destinations. Where as in Chicago, it might be a $40-50 uber to downtown, biking to work isn’t viable for most, etc.

in general, i am very bullish on them if they are within about a $20 uber of a decent downtown & can be oriented part of that ecosystem. But if they are oriented toward suburbia the rest of sububria, i think they are going to have more issues.

Whether or not uber exists, Transportation-as-a-service will persist. Drivers are likely to cease to be part of that model. They already aren’t part of dockless ebikes or e-scooters. Self-driving vehicles are an eventuality.

I live in a “Stoneston” house, produced by the brothers who developed the Stonestown mall and adjacent housing in San Francisco in the early 50s Levittown mold.

It’s clear my subdivision was meant for blue collar GIs as there’s only two basic floor plans, both around 1000 square feet. In many parts of the country, this would be a decaying inner ring suburb, but here… https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/226-Dundee-Dr_South-San-Francisco_CA_94080_M10294-30654?view=qv

Even given the property tax windfall, the local government has trouble paying the bills. I wondered how could that be? Well, Strong Towns `splained that one pretty good.

A similar trajectory is in progress for Alexandria, Virginia’s Landmark Mall. The years of being half-empty, the wig shop equivalent, the ethnic clothing, the homeless shelter, and the closure of the anchor stores – Sears among them.

However, this small city is within minutes of Washington DC, just across the river and accessible by road, bus, or subway. Our home prices (and taxes!) keep rising and we await Amazon’s arrival to turn the entire newly coined “National Landing” area into a tech hub.

Landmark Mall has been slated for redevelopment for years by its owner, the Howard Hughes Corporation. Hughes and the city planners have been negotiating the usage intent, architecture, roads and utilities, etc, etc for over a decade – the project was first stalled by the 2008 financial crisis. Until I see the bulldozers I won’t believe construction is actually starting.

The point I’d like to share is that the mall concept doesn’t work in most places, not just dying suburbs. Mass retail has already been obsoleted by Amazon and the discount warehouses. Sure, we have a few large area malls with upscale shoppers and many high-end stores, but they tend to have a critical mass of affluent mixed use or urban surroundings rather than acres of asphalt parking and access highways. Landmark is supposed to become mixed use, we’ll see.

The most interesting use of a declining mall that I have seen is in Fort Worth TX where a local generic mall has been completely converted over to Hispanic businesses and appears to be thriving. Had to go there once because there was an immigrations office inside where I needed to do some paperwork for my wife who was an immigrant from Chile. It had less than a 10% occupancy rate in 2004 when the current owners bought it and converted it over to Hispanic-themed businesses.

I’ve seen something a little like that in the MainPlace Mall in Santa Ana. There’s a large Hispanic population there and they’ve now got a couple of Hispanic-oriented businesses, plus a playground, second-run movie theater, and an arcade/entertainment center all geared towards entertaining children and teens. It’s been relatively successful in that the mall now has a lot of foot traffic after getting kind of sick during the financial crises, although it still has a fair number of empty stores (mostly disguised so they don’t look so bad). It’s losing anchors but redeveloping the spaces with restaurant, gyms, and entertainment spaces. Now they’re planning to convert much of the parking lots to residential and mixed use.

The retail environment was way overbuilt long before Amazon, et al came along. I would guess by 1990 retail was overdone in most areas. In no small part due to huge tax subsidies. Despite that, I surmise favorable demographics and sledgehammer advertising kept retail going a while longer. But it was clear to me stagnating incomes and shifting tastes would do in a lot of stores, long before half dead malls became a trend.

This is an enormous country and there are Levittowns in basically every metro area of the country. The next 20 years or so are going to be an interesting period to watch and see how many (if any) of these places manage to turn things around and what strategies they use do to it.

My guess is that location will be everything and location will be destiny. Probably nothing can be done to save sprawling aging low-density burbs around declining cities like say Peoria or Shreveport. But burbs that are strategically located close enough to major job centers in expensive growing cities have a chance.

^^Yes, this. I gave up working in urban redevelopment for a while because it has a standard playbook, and professionally moved to a well-positioned first/second ring suburb.

There is not yet a good playbook for declining first-ring suburban, beyond the sub-rosa tactical urbanism that Johnny often explains here. Some TIF, some zoning changes, some infill. But also (curiously) some new strip commercial right next to older/underutilized spaces. And precious little of the densification needed to support the commercial and the municipal tax base.

As Kent points out, in general those first ring ‘burbs with location advantages (normally near eds/meds/tech in a state capital or Big State U. hometown) will probably have the land value to support revitalization. Places like Ferguson, probably not so much.

I’m not so sure eds, meds and tech will be such safe bets. Eds and meds have far, far outstripped the rest of society in rising costs and have created a bubble for themselves, mostly through bloated administrative overhead. Higher Ed has compounded it’s cost problem by degrading it’s product as well. There’s going to be a rebellion against the student loan abomination and a rapid deflation of the Ed bubble withing 10 to 15 years.

Meds are at least still providing a useful service (and growing in demand as the Boomers age-related medical problems mount), but it’s due for a retraction in money flows too.

Tech is a mixed bag – a huge amount of tech money is tied to the Fed trying to goose the money supply, and that’s another thing that can’t go on forever. There’s still going to be tech development and tech spending, but it too will likely contract as the system clears a couple decades worth of malinvestsments.

Bottom line, I expect spending in heavy ed/med/tech areas to collapse/retreat/stagnate (respectively) over the timeframe of these neighborhoods going through their decline phase. With so many aspects of those local economies predicated on their own ponzi schemes of perpetual growth, even a temporary stagnation will be stressful.

Ah, but such neighborhoods offer retreat from bubble-fueled downtowns…they offer adaptable lower cost living.

Their garages (business incubators) and yards (large gardens) can be used productively as Johnny repeatedly shows. Dry basements can become secondary housing units.

Most of the time it can be done without running afoul of the HOA busybodies or even the zoning police.
