### Time flies

Go 1.6 is one year old (Happy Birthday!)

Go 1.7 is already 6 months old!

Go 1.8 was released on February 16th.

### Notes

The slides are available on [talks.golang.org/2017/state-of-go.slide](https://talks.golang.org/2017/state-of-go.slide)

Most of the code examples won't run except locally and using Go 1.8.

The playground still runs Go 1.7.

Use the left and right arrow keys or click the left and right edges of the page to navigate between slides.
