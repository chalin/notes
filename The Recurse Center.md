# *The *Recurse Center

 **What we do.** The Recurse Center is a self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers in New York City.

 **Our philosophy.** We believe people learn best when they take control of their own education and are free to explore what they’re interested in. RC is heavily influenced by unschooling.

 **Never graduate.** RC doesn’t end after you leave. We have a diverse, active, and engaged alumni community of over 1,200 smart, enthusiastic, helpful programmers all over the world.

 **Build a career.** We’re here to support you at every stage of your career, whether you’re looking for a new job or not, and whether you just finished RC or attended many years ago.
