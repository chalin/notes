From OSCON 2015: It wasn’t too long ago that artisans, bathed in the glow of molten metal, forged parts that would go on to make up bigger, more powerful machines. Today, we call those artisans developers. Instead of metal, they use bits and bytes in the cloud to forge a modern application architecture.

It’s an architecture built for velocity and choice. One that enables companies to build applications quickly and deploy them wherever they need to go, whether public, private, or hybrid environments. And it’s built on a growing, vibrant ecosystem of ecosystems.

In this talk, I’ll give you a look at the technologies driving this new level of speed and efficiency for application developers (such tech as containers, Docker, Kubernetes, OpenStack, and Cloud Foundry). And I’ll explain why many prominent members of the Fortune 500 are building their futures on this modern application architecture.

About Sam Ramji:

Sam Ramji is CEO of the Cloud Foundry Foundation. He has over 20 years of industry experience in enterprise software, product development, and open source strategy. Sam previously served as vice president of strategy of Apigee, one of the five fastest-growing software companies in the Deloitte Fast 500, and is a member of their board of advisors. He joined Apigee from Microsoft, where he was responsible for driving Microsoft’s worldwide open source strategy. He drove many of Microsoft’s contributions to open source and its shift to embrace open source technologies like PHP. He was a leader in BEA’s move into EAI/ESB as a founding member of the AquaLogic product team. Sam has built large-scale enterprise and web-scale applications, leading the Ofoto engineering team through its acquisition by Kodak.

From OSCON 2015 in Portland: The Federal Government’s approach to technology is outdated and maddening. But this dysfunction didn’t come out of thin air—it’s rooted in deep, structural realities. Less than a year old, the U.S. Digital Service is hacking bureaucracy and improving services millions rely on every day. Mikey will talk about how that work is going and how the group is spurring change in the open.

About Mikey Dickerson:

In 2013, Mikey Dickerson joined what became known as the “ad hoc” team, tasked with rescuing HealthCare.gov after its disastrous launch on October 1. In August 2014, President Obama established the United States Digital Service and tapped Mikey to serve as the Administrator to see if the strategy that succeeded at pulling Healthcare.gov out of the fire could be applied to other government problems.

Prior to his service in government, Mikey worked in Site Reliability Engineering at Google from 2006 to 2014. He took a brief hiatus in 2008 and 2012 to work on the presidential campaigns, and in 2012 helped write software and oversee computer systems for several programs, including the critical “get out the vote” campaign.
