Description

"Optimism"

Reginald lives with depression. In this talk he will share Dr. Martin Seligmanâ€™s three techniques for reprogramming our brains to think optimistically, and explain how they have helped him feel better, accomplish more, and be a better member of the Ruby community. Whether you have ever struggled with your mood or not, they just might help you change your life.
