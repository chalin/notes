How much would brown rice compared to white rice matter if one is already vegan and already getting the nutrients that are lost when you refine the rice into white? Even eating white rice I am high fiber plenty of fruit and veg.

I stopped with the brown rice because of the pollutants and contaminants that the husk / bran layer can retain. Now I need to go back?

What else were these people eating in these studies in the video? Does the white or brown rice question really matter when one is already vegan?[Report](#)

What I don’t like about those studies they don’t reveal the whole story. Is the brown rice better because of the fiber. What was the overall diet? What else did they eat? Fieber plays a big role in blood sugar. How much fiber did they eat each day? It doesn’t proof anything.[Report](#)

I keep reading different sources that talk about brown rice containing arsenic (see link below). Is this true? If so, it seems a better plan to eat white rice with beans and veg.

“Brown rice contains a very unsafe level of arsenic and the grain shouldn’t be consumed. In test, some brown rice brands contained at least 50% more arsenic than the safe limit per serving. A few brands even had nearly double the safe limit of arsenic in the product.” http://alkalinevalleyfoods.com/youve-been-lied-to-7-disturbing-facts-about-how-eating-brown-rice-can-damage-your-health/[Report](#)

johan003: Whether or not brown rice contains any significant amount of arsenic depends on a number of factors. There are some brands out now which are tested and certified to be arsenic free. I don’t know if the following is true or not, but poster “jj” had the following to say and you could check on it:

.

“Compared with the results for the 1300 rices tested by FDA and with the results for rice tested by Consumer Reports in their independent investigation, Lotus Foods rices have among the lowest levels of total arsenic of any rice on the market, and in some cases the lowest levels. None of the regions where Lotus Foods rice is grown have any known arsenic contamination. They are participating in the “more crop per drop” experiments on growing rice. I am just a happy consumer.”

.

“jj” also gave us a link that shows amount of arsenic by country. That link is not working now for me, but maybe you could find the data and then source your rice based on this information to lower your exposure.

.

You might also want to look into the following article that Tom Goff found. Does steaming rice in a coffee percolator remove most of the arsenic? http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11755755/Can-rice-give-you-cancer-Not-if-you-cook-it-in-a-coffee-percolator.html (Cool find!)

.

My 2 cents: The issue is not of great concern to me as I just don’t eat all that much rice. When I do eat rice, I eat brown when I can and don’t worry about it. The following comment from Dr. Forrester puts things into perspective for me: http://nutritionfacts.org/video/worth-switching-white-rice-brown/#comment-2728520810. Tom Goff’s comment underneath Dr. Forrester’s comment is also helpful.

.

If I ate a lot of rice and/or this issue was of great concern to me, I would choose the tested and arsenic-free brown rice over eating white rice. (The information in the NutritionFacts video on this page explains why.) Here’s one more twist: Generally if I’m eating rice, I prefer black or red over brown as those varieties may be even healthier than brown. (see http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brown-rice-vs-black-rice/ and http://nutritionfacts.org/video/brown-black-purple-red-unlike-white-rice/ ) But I think the same issues re: contaminants and looking for tested brands would apply to black or red as well. You just have to pick your brand wisely.[Report](#)

This seems like scare-mongering, to be honest.

It is certainly true that some brown rice is high in inorganic arsenic but the risk really depends on how much you eat on a long term basis. As a recent draft FDA risk report notes

” The estimated mean inorganic arsenic concentration was 92 ppb in white rice and 154 ppb in brown rice. The mean inorganic arsenic concentration in dry infant brown-rice cereal was 119 ppb, and the mean inorganic arsenic concentration in dry infant white-rice cereal was 104 ppb. These levels do not pose a health concern for immediate toxicity, but the levels may pose a risk following long-term exposure.”

http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodScienceResearch/RiskSafetyAssessment/UCM486543.pdf

I eat (brown) rice a couple of times a week and do not consider the risk at all meaningful. On the other hand, if you are a member of a culture that eats rice 2 or 3 times a day, then it may be worth considering reducing brown rice intake or adopting different cooking/processing methods. In addition to Thea’s very helpful summary of the issues below, you may also want to consider this study that showed that high volume cooking ie 6 or more parts of water for every 1 part of rice substantially reduces arsenic content

What about brown rice versus pearl barley? Barely has more fiber and I like it more, is it better than brown rice? [Report](#)

Hi, Nicholas. I am Christine, a NF Volunteer Nutrition Moderator. It is difficult to say that one food is better than another. As you point out, pearled barley has more fiber than brown rice. It also has more calcium, iron, potassium, zinc, choline, folate, and vitamins A and K. On the other hand, brown rice has slightly more protein, more magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, thiamin, niacin, pantothenic acid, and vitamin E. Because you like barley, you should definitely include it in your diet, but maybe it would be a good idea to include some brown rice also. I hope that helps![Report](#)

I cannot find unadulterated brown rice…this is what I found in my local supermarket, “Easy cook brown rice, part-cooked and lightly milled”(?!) Hmm, well, that “Easy cook” rice takes 25 mins to cook anyway and I suppose the lightly milled bit means that some, if not all, of the goodness has been taken away. And I bet because it has been partly cooked, what was left of any nutritional value has been washed away![Report](#)

Susie: I know a lot of places now carry the more processed brown rice, but I’ve never had trouble getting the plain brown rice. I would agree with you the brown rice you are describing is not as good as regular brown rice, but I would guess that it is better than white rice.

.

If you can find another convenient grocery store, you might find better results? FYI: Fred Myers has a pretty good bulk section, at least where I live. You can get cheap, regular brown rice and as little or as much as you want. Good luck.[Report](#)

Thanks, Thea, I will try at a local ethnic store. And you are tight, even the partly-milled should be better than white rice.[Report](#)

A focus group of chinese adults. I wonder if the preference/attraction/obsession for pale/lighter/whiter skin in China also transfers to their initial thoughts on white vs brown rice?? Whether it was a “did you say brown – oh then it must be worse” response.. Or if it was a matter of familiar vs unfamiliar.. Or both these reasons? And if anything was subconscious..? The psychologist in me has been excited..

Not trying to be racist haha but just thought of this when the vid mentioned ‘chinese and white vs brown’.. What’re your thoughts?[Report](#)

No, it has nothing to do with skin color. It’s because historically, white rice (being more delicate, tasty, and soft) was considered an upper-class food, something for wealthier people, because it takes more time and energy to dehull rice. Only peasants ate brown rice. The association continued up until modern times. Machines made it easy and cheap to make white rice, and people of all incomes could afford it, and of course everyone wants access to a luxury good. Now everyone eats white rice and it is the norm. A similar process occurred in the west with brown bread and white bread.[Report](#)

But this intervention study didn’t answer on the most important question:
Does brown rice better than nothing?
It’s still high in both GI and GL ,
So i still doubt about it.
Another fault with this study,
Is that it’s not “blind” study.[Report](#)

I HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY ABOUT THIS ARSENIC CONTROVERSY. IT IS VERY SIMPLE, YET I AM GUESSING THE ANALYTICAL CHEMISTS TOTALLY OVERLOOKED IT. IF MY CONCLUSIONS ARE WRONG, PLEASE CORRECT ME.

THE TESTS DID NOT WASH THE BROWN RICE BEFORE COOKING! I GOT INVOLVED IN MACROBIOTICS, WHICH IS A JAPANESE VEGAN COOKING SYSTEM, THOUGH I THINK OTHER ORGANIC COOKS KNOW THIS. YOU PUT YOUR BROWN RICE IN A CLAY POT, AND REPEATEDLY WASH IT WITH COLD WATER UNTIL THE WATER IS CLEAR. WASHING IT INVOLVES STIRRING IT WITH YOUR FINGERS, SO THE BROWN RICE GRAINS GRIND AGAINST EACH OTHER. THIS TAKES SOME TIME, AND I GENERALLY USE AROUND 5 CHANGES OF COLD WATER OR MORE. THIS PROCESS TAKES UP TO 10 MINUTES.

I CATCH THE RICE IN A STRAINER – STIR- DRAIN-REFILL-STIR-ETC THE WATER IS INITIALLY QUITE CLOUDY AND THEN BECOMES CLEAR GRADUALLY.

I AM A HARVARD TRAINED BIOCHEMIST AND AN ANALYTICAL CHEMIST WITH EXPERIENCE TESTING NATURAL PRODUCTS. SAMPLE PREPARATION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF AN ANALYSIS. IT’S THE OLD GARBAGE-IN, GARBAGE-OUT ISSUE. YOU CAN’T JUST PRESENT NUMBERS LIKE THEY DROPPED OUT OF THE HEAVENS.

IN THIS CASE, OF COURSE, NOT EVERYONE KNOWS HOW TO PREPARE BROWN RICE, SO THEY DON’T WASH IT. BUT IF YOU WERE TESTING CHICKEN FOR BACTERIA, WOULD YOU TEST IT WITH FEATHERS ON? ANYONE KNOW HOW THEY PREPARED THE BROWN RICE SAMPLES? ANYONE WANT TO WAGER ON THIS WITH ME?

OH, and I just saw in the conclusion, Dr Greger referred to a comment that many asians felt brown rice to have an inferior taste and texture. Again, if you know how to cook it, then that may change. First, wash it like I mention above. Then, according to macrobiotics, who are heavy brown-rice-eaters, put the washed rice into a clay pot in a pressure cooker for 45 minutes. This makes the rice taste sweet and juicy. Standard condiments are gomasio and tamari, both rich in salt. Gomasio is roasted sesame seeds ground together with 10% sea salt. the seeds are roasted in a flat fry pan. Tamari is fermented soy sauce, and an expensive grade best, since you don’t use much, and cheaper grades from China may be adulterated with burnt wheat.

So the paper authors, again, may be off the mark, in just boiling unwashed whole grain brown rice. The Japanese methods are worth learning, since these are the sub-group who actually eat brown rice daily. The above procedure may sound laborious compared to an electric rice cooker. If you wash the rice, you can get OK results with a cooker, is my taste opinion. But I still go to the trouble. Hey, it’s still easier than cutting a chicken’s head off![Report](#)
