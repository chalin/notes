TEALS – Computer Science in Every High School

[How can I volunteer?](https://www.tealsk12.org/volunteers/)

# Help us close the computer science gap

##### Computer Science in Every High School

Learning computer science empowers young people to compete in the global economy and pursue careers across all sectors because it teaches students computational thinking and problem solving skills applicable in any industry.

Students want to learn computer science yet most high schools are unable to offer rigorous CS courses.

## TEALS is increasing access to CS education

##### Why volunteer with TEALS?

Microsoft Philanthropies TEALS (Technology Education and Literacy in Schools) helps high schools throughout the US and British Columbia, Canada build and grow sustainable computer science programs. In its proven program, TEALS pairs trained computer science professionals from across the technology industry with classroom teachers to team-teach computer science. Industry volunteers and partner teachers create a ripple effect, impacting the students they teach, and the many students who will study CS in the future. TEALS was founded in 2009 by former high school CS teacher and Microsoft engineer Kevin Wang, who now runs the program full time.

School Administrators

Administrators work with TEALS to support the school partnership by making accommodations within their school schedule and budget to support computer science classes, and planning for the future. Their guidance and leadership ensures that a single TEALS course ultimately grows into a robust and sustainable CS program at the school.

Teachers

TEALS exists to help classroom teachers learn how to teach CS and build a CS program at their school. Teachers from various content backgrounds work in partnership with TEALS volunteers to team-teach classes and prepare to teach CS on their own.

Students

Students who are interested in bringing CS classes to their school can become advocates to create change by sharing their interest with teachers, administrators and parents, and introducing them to the TEALS program.
