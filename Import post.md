Import post

# Import post

To import a post published elsewhere onto Medium:

1. Click your user icon > Stories > Import or go to https://medium.com/p/import.

2. Paste the URL of the story you'd like to import into the field.
3. Click Import.
4. Click See your story to edit.

Imported stories will automatically apply a canonical URL referencing the original source material.

As the import tool is automated, it may not work on all sources. If it does not function as expected, go to your target URL > copy the content > paste it into a new Medium draft > make any edits. Email us the Medium post URL and the original source URL and we can set a canonical link for you manually.

**Note**: You may only import content from other sites for which you have the right to do so.
