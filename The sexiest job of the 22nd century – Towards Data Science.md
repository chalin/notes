Data science has been called “[the sexiest job of the 21st century](http://bit.ly/sexy21cjob)” — a sentiment I’d believe if I saw more business leaders hiring data scientists into environments where we can be effective. Instead, many of us feel misunderstood and invisible. The world isn’t ready for us (yet).

### Who we are

We are the people who help [inspire](http://bit.ly/quaesita_analysts) new directions for your business, reduce your risk of setting [important decisions](http://bit.ly/quaesita_statistics) on fire, and [automate the ineffable](http://bit.ly/quaesita_simplest) through machine learning and AI. We make your data useful, yet you make us live in resource squalor. You ask us to make our peace with:

**Unskilled leadership** — If you don’t have personnel [skilled at leading and managing the data science function](http://bit.ly/quaesita_dsleaders), we’ll have a miserable time. When you don’t have decision-makers skilled at assigning work appropriately and making [data-driven](http://bit.ly/quaesita_inspired) decision, employers will keep calling their data scientists [useless](http://bit.ly/quaesita_bubble).

**No data** — If you hire data scientists before [data engineers](http://bit.ly/quaesita_roles), it usually means we have no data to work with and we must first build the data engineering function for you or we’re forced to tuck and roll. If we stay, we end up doing a job other than the one you claim you’re hiring us for. I’ve [said it](http://bit.ly/quaesita_aibias) and I’ll keep saying it: you need high-quality [data](http://bit.ly/quaesita_hist) for data science to be effective. We’re not magical leprechauns, so we can’t make something out of nothing for you.

**Nasty tools** — Data science developer tools are a misery. The ecosystem is fragmented, especially when it comes to AI, and even the best options are far from perfect. There’s always something that makes the ride bumpy.

If you’re interviewing for a data science gig, make sure you grill your potential employer about their plan for all three of these points so you don’t end up in a sad spot. Don’t forget to ask about *people* - **whose** job is it to make sure you have [data](http://bit.ly/quaesita_hist)? **Who** gets fired if all your insights aren’t used for anything? **Who** picks the tools you use and makes sure they play nice with all the other infrastructure?

![1*TpAfeJbo1UQQTwor9lpc0g.jpeg](../_resources/3390daad0e7873551cca31cfed58a235.jpg)

I’ve written plenty about [leadership](http://bit.ly/quaesita_dsleaders) and [data](http://bit.ly/quaesita_hist), so it’s high time I mentioned tools. Applied [data scientists](http://bit.ly/quaesita_datasci) (including those working on [ML/AI](http://bit.ly/quaesita_emperor)) [don’t want to build our tools from scratch](http://bit.ly/quaesita_kubeflow) (that’s a different job - if we wanted it, we’d be in it already). For example, we’d much rather use an existing package to make a [histogram](http://bit.ly/quaesita_hist) than write the code that displays rectangles to a screen. Asking us to roll our own is like asking you to [build your own microwave](http://bit.ly/quaesita_fail) if you’re opening a restaurant. We’ll build them if we have to, but we’d prefer to jump straight into the cooking.

### Working with Satan

Sometimes the proprietary tools that management foists on data scientists are even worse than the ones they could cobble together themselves. I remember one that my friends had nicknamed “Satan” — as in, “Yeah, I know that takes one line in R but it you should probably budget all day to get it working in Satan.” It’s hard to go through the day with a song in your heart when the tools at your disposal are horrible.

### Take a designer’s perspective

Sometimes the trouble with available tools is in the eye of the beholder - perhaps the root of your frustration is that you’ve picked up a tool that wasn’t made for you. Let’s take a look at two tools of Google origin. [Keras](http://keras.io/) is not only a beautiful API, but it was built with the data scientist in mind. For example, [Keras](http://keras.io/)’s error messages are designed to guide the data scientist’s next move, so they’re concise and friendly-looking, while an equivalent mistake in [TensorFlow](http://bit.ly/quaesita_tf) spits out a text jumble of [Dickensian proportions](http://bit.ly/dickens4m). This shouldn’t surprise you if you put your design thinking hat on; as the industrial lathe of AI, [TensorFlow](http://bit.ly/quaesita_tf) was not originally designed with data science users in mind. It was made for researchers breaking new ground at Google scale… and it’s good at what it’s built for.

The great news for us data science types is that even [TensorFlow](http://bit.ly/quaesita_tf) is getting more cuddly. The new 2.0 release is moving in our direction and it shows. Instead of grumbling about what’s still missing, I’m cheering them on! I can’t wait to have a laptop sticker that says “I love TensorFlow” (as opposed to “I tolerate TensorFlow because it’s the only thing that handles my data at this scale”).

I’m delighted to be part of [TensorFlow](http://bit.ly/quaesita_tf) initiatives that explicitly identify data scientists as primary users. One example I’m excited to tell you all about in a future post is the What-If Tool, which makes model understanding, bias detection, and ML data exploration easy. The team included a user experience designer tasked with making [data scientists](http://bit.ly/quaesita_datasci) happy... from *Day 1*! You can sneak a look at the results [here](http://bit.ly/whatiftool).

### If it’s not made for you, it probably won’t fit you

It’s important to take a moment to think about the origins of a tool you’re considering learning as well as the communities its builders are making overtures towards as they’re steering the development of new versions.

### Try before you buy

While we’re at it, if you’re calling the tooling shots for your organization, don’t commit to a tool before your data scientists have playtested it. You’d think this would go without saying, but Satan suggests otherwise. Thinking about picking up a tool built for analysts in the retail space and plugging it right into your healthcare company? Oh dear. You might want to consider some tooling support from dedicated engineers so your data scientists aren’t miserable. Your current analysts probably didn’t sign up for dealing with what will feel like a piece of junk to them, and they might not have been around the block enough times to know to ask about tools (and engineering support for these tools!) during their interviews.

### Punchline

If you’re a data scientist looking for a new gig, don’t forget to check that whoever you’re about to trust with your career understands your needs. Ask potential employers pointed questions about data, decision-makers, and tools. Make sure they have what our kind needs to be happy and effective. If you love the work, I’d hate to see you become [yet another](http://bit.ly/quaesita_bubble) Director of Data Science in a company with no data!
