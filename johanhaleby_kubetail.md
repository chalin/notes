# [(L)](https://github.com/johanhaleby/kubetail#kubetail)Kubetail

Bash script that enables you to aggregate (tail/follow) logs from multiple pods into one stream. This is the same as running "kubectl logs -f " but for multiple pods.

## [(L)](https://github.com/johanhaleby/kubetail#installation)Installation

Just download the [kubetail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johanhaleby/kubetail/master/kubetail) file (or any of the [releases](https://github.com/johanhaleby/kubetail/releases)) and you're good to go.

### [(L)](https://github.com/johanhaleby/kubetail#homebrew)Homebrew

You can also install kubetail using [brew](https://brew.sh/):

	$ brew tap johanhaleby/kubetail && brew install kubetail

Use ` brew install --HEAD kubetail ` to install the latest (unreleased) version.

## [(L)](https://github.com/johanhaleby/kubetail#usage)Usage

First find the names of all your pods:

	$ kubectl get pods

This will return a list looking something like this:
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
app1-v1-aba8y 1/1 Running 0 1d
app1-v1-gc4st 1/1 Running 0 1d
app1-v1-m8acl 1/1 Running 0 6d
app1-v1-s20d0 1/1 Running 0 1d
app2-v31-9pbpn 1/1 Running 0 1d
app2-v31-q74wg 1/1 Running 0 1d
my-demo-v5-0fa8o 1/1 Running 0 3h
my-demo-v5-yhren 1/1 Running 0 2h
To tail the logs of the two "app2" pods in one go simply do:

	$ kubetail app2

To tail only a specific container from multiple pods specify the container like this:

	$ kubetail app2 -c container1

You can repeat ` -c ` to tail multiple specific containers:

	$ kubetail app2 -c container1 -c contianer2

Supply ` -h ` for help and addtional options:

	$ kubetail -h

## [(L)](https://github.com/johanhaleby/kubetail#colors)Colors

By using the ` -k ` argument you can specifiy how kubetail makes use of colors (only applicable when tailing multiple pods).

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| pod | Only the pod name is colorized but the logged text is using the terminal default color |
| line | The entire line is colorized (default) |
| false | Don't colorize the output at all |

Example:

	$ kubetail app2 -k false

## [(L)](https://github.com/johanhaleby/kubetail#filtering--highlighting-etc)Filtering / Highlighting etc

kubetail itself doesn't have filitering or highlighting capabilities built-in. If you're on MacOSX I recommend using [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) which allows for continuous highlighting of search terms, good scrolling capabilities and multitab arrangements. Another useful feature of iTerm2 is the "timeline" (` cmd ` + ` shift ` + ` e `) which lets you display a timeline in your own local timezone next to the logs (that are typically in UTC).

If you're not using iTerm2 or think that kubetail is lacking in features there's a [fork](https://github.com/aks/kubetail) of kubetail made by [Alan Stebbens](https://github.com/aks) that allows for richer configuration and uses [multitail](https://www.vanheusden.com/multitail/) and [bash-lib](https://github.com/aks/bash-lib). Alan has been kind enough to provide a pull request but my current thinking is that I'd like kubetail to stay simple and small and not use any dependencies.

## [(L)](https://github.com/johanhaleby/kubetail#known-issues)Known issues

When you press "ctrl+c" to end the log session you may end up with errors like this:

error: write /dev/stdout: broken pipe
I'm not quite sure why this happens, pull requests are welcome :)
