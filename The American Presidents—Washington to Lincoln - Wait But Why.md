The American Presidents—Washington to Lincoln - Wait But Why

# The American Presidents—Washington to Lincoln

President’s Day is one of those weird American holidays where no one quite knows why it’s there or what it is, but it’s a day off so no one asks too many questions.

The holiday kind of celebrates Washington’s birthday (February 22), kind of celebrates both Washington and Lincoln’s birthdays (Feb 22 and 12), and kind of celebrates all 43 presidents all at once.

In any case, it seemed like the perfect time to research presidents for 60 hours and post a 7,000-word, 30-hour-late post diving into who each American president really was and what he really did. (My apologies to all non-American readers—you did nothing to deserve this.)

In deciding where to start, I looked at the whole line of presidents, and it turns out the story of the United States divides cleanly into three even parts, each 75 years long:

I’d like to eventually go through all 43 American presidents, but for today, it made perfect sense to start out with the first and most unstable part of US history, the one bookended by the two birthday boys, Washington and Lincoln, and the section during which the country’s borders, laws, principles, and national identity were all still forming. Let’s call it the “Shaping the Nation Era.” This era was a time when major precedents were being set with every new administration, allowing the 16 presidents discussed below to shape the nation in a deeper way than anyone today could have the opportunity to.

Here’s a chart depicting the results of every election and how the political parties have shifted over time, further exemplifying how much more chaotic the Washington-Lincoln years were than the rest of US history:

Before we get started, eight general thoughts I had during my research:

**1) 17/43 presidents, or 40% of them, were named John, James, George, or William.**

**2) There was a Mustache Era. **The 44 years between 1869 and 1913 saw 9 presidents, *8** of whom had mustaches:*

And never before or after this era did *any* other president have a mustache.
**3) There was a ridiculous run of terrible presidents between 1841 and 1877.**

I call it The Bad President Circus, and we’ll cover most of it today. Below is a chart showing just how dire this period was. Each square represents one of the 44 presidencies, in order (so Washington is all the way on the left and Obama is all the way on the right). The red squares represent the bottom 10 ranked* presidents:

[![squares](../_resources/426de9ad0dc7c5c1ab5f18c0a7339fd4.png)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/squares2.png)

Starting with William Henry Harrison and ending with Ulysses S. Grant, The Bad President Circus is a run of ten presidents that include *eight of the bottom ten in history. *A grim time.

**

4) It’s crazy to me that each of the most famous presidents has at least one parent who has no idea their son turned out to be anything special.**

George Washington’s dad died when he was 11. Imagine dying and never knowing that your son is *the great George Washington.*

Thomas Jefferson’s dad died when he was 14.

Andrew Jackson’s dad died when he was an infant and his mom died when he was 14.

Abraham Lincoln’s mom died when he was 9.

It turns out that this is more the rule than the exception—of the most recent 10 presidents, only JFK and George W. Bush have two parents who know they raised an American president. The concept blows my mind.

**5) A president’s “last words” is a funny phenomenon. **I included the below presidents’ last words whenever they were known. They’re mostly poetic and grand, clearly having been planned in advance and thought through carefully. The funny thing is picturing a president lying on his deathbed, surrounded by family, and his entire mind focused on when to say the key “last words” sentence. If he says it too early, he then has to not say anything again and that gets awkward if someone asks him a question or he lives a couple more days (this may have happened to Jefferson, as you’ll see). If he waits too long, he dies without saying the correct last words. One final quandary to deal with for these men who worked so hard to shape their historical legacies.

And some thoughts specifically on the first 16 presidents:

**6) People were obsessed with dying back then. **Learning about these 16 men, their families, friends, and contemporaries, it’s astounding how much easier it was to die just 200 years ago in the US. It seems like children had no more than a 50% chance of making it past age five, and once an adult hit 50, something like catching a cold or eating spoiled food could very well mean you were dead five days later. Tragedy was a much more prominent part of life in those times.

**7) Books were everything. **Many of these early presidents received some or most of their thorough educations from reading books on their own. It’s a reminder of how groundbreaking the invention of the mass-produced book was. Until then, the only way to learn something was through having a human explain it to you in person. The book allowed a hungry learner (which these 16 guys almost all were) to take things into their own hands and absorb the thoughts and knowledge of thousands of other people’s brains. And looking at it from the other side, it allowed someone like Abraham Lincoln to publish the Lincoln-Douglas debates and transmit his thoughts on slavery to tens of thousands of people throughout the country, as if each book were a mini-version of him and he could suddenly be everywhere at the same time.

**8) The story of the first third of the nation’s history can be pretty well summed up with one sentence:**

*Aggressive (and controversial) expansion of United States territory exacerbated the nation’s tensest and most divisive debate—slavery—by forcing the question of whether the new territories should be able to self-determine whether or not to allow slavery, highlighting the haziness around where state rights end and federal power begins and accelerating the nation toward Civil War.*

Sure, there were debates about the National Bank and tariffs, over the treatment of Native Americans and dealings with Europe, but *most* of the major issues these 16 presidents faced were contained somewhere within that italicized sentence.

***A note on rankings: **The presidential ranking I used for each president both in the chart above and below each portrait was taken from [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_United_States_Presidents), which averages out a large number of polls taken over time and spanning the political spectrum.

And off we go—
**1) George Washington**

[(L)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/washington.png)

[![washington](../_resources/c329aa7b63ece1f618a4115e19e54bcf.png)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/washington.png)

**Presidency:** 1789 – 1797 **Lived:** 1732 – 1799 **Ranking:** 3/43
**Slave Owner?** Yes.

**His Deal: **A man’s man. No high school, no college, no law school, just a lot of manly prudence and wisdom. A key officer in the French and Indian War and the head general in the Revolutionary War, he was the only person everyone trusted to handle being the first president responsibly. And for good reason—after winning the Revolutionary War, he resigned as commander-in-chief rather than seize power, and when he took the office of President, he made sure not to act like a king or dictator, limited himself to two terms, and left office with a peaceful transition of power—setting these as key precedents for the future of the country. He’s one of those people Americans aren’t allowed to say anything bad about.

**His Presidency: **A generally peaceful time, although he had to deal with Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson, his two key cabinet members, having tantrums at each other over differing views of policy the whole time. In his farewell address, he cautioned against the evils of partisanship and the dangers of getting involved in foreign wars—Americans have heeded those words and to this day, we remain a nonpartisan country that never gets involved in unnecessary wars abroad.

**Things He Can Brag About: **

- Being the first president
- Being nicknamed “The Father of Our Country”—fun nickname to have
- Being the one to select Washington, D.C. as the location of the nation’s capital
- Being the only president to win an election with 100% of the electoral votes
- One day, Jimmy Carter decided that Washington should be named a “six-star general,” so now he’s the highest-ranking military officer in US history
- Being on the quarter, the one dollar bill, and Mount Rushmore
- Having nine trillion things named after him, including being the only president with a state named after him
- Being the largest distiller of whiskey in all of Virginia

**Things He Hopes We Don’t Remember: **

- He owned slaves his whole life, and his estate owned over 300 when he died. He had them all freed after his death, but not a minute earlier.

**Things He’s Annoyed About: **

- Losing all of his teeth by the time he took office
- His overbearing mom who disapproved of the Revolution

**Other Notable Facts: **

- He apparently had quite a sassy side—he was a great dancer, an interior decorator, and a passionate fashionista.
- Martha Washington was 5’0″ to his 6’3″.
- His first inaugural speech was 183 words long and lasted 90 seconds. His second one was even shorter.
- He was generally filthy and hated taking baths.
- His annual salary was $25,000, equivalent to over $500,000 today, and he spent 7% of that on alcohol.
- He wouldn’t shake anyone’s hand because he thought it was beneath the president to do so, and bowed instead (Thomas Jefferson reversed this tradition a decade later).
- Upon his death, his estate was worth $1 million, or $19 million in today’s dollars.

**Last Words: **“Tis well.” Washington was too cool to give a shit about last words.

**2) John Adams**

[(L)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/adams-2.png)

[![John Adams](../_resources/b74c5d1ea9c120952bfd7e2c6ca22439.png)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/adams-2.png)

**Presidency:** 1797 – 1801 **Lived:** 1735 – 1826 **Ranking:** 12/43
**Slave Owner? **No.

**His Deal: **A short, fat, highly educated intellectual whose philosophies on government played a critical role in the founding policies of the nation. His drafting of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1779 provided much of the thought and structure for the eventual American Constitution, and he was on the committee that drafted the Declaration of Independence (and was the original man chosen to write it before he passed the honor on to Thomas Jefferson). He was also the one who nominated George Washington to be commander-in-chief and John Marshall to be Supreme Court Chief Justice, both of which turned out to be brilliant moves.

His main issue was that he wasn’t one of the cool kids. Most of the founding fathers were quiet, dignified Southerners, and they didn’t particularly like or embrace Adams, or invite him to their birthday parties. He spent his whole life frustrated about this, and it really did matter—with a larger circle of powerful friends (Washington was one but he died right after his term ended), he might have had more support when he was the president, accomplished more, been elected to a second term, and be on Mount Rushmore and the ten dollar bill today.

**His Presidency: **Adams’ presidency had some successes, like preventing a war with France when many were urging him to fight, but he spent most of his time in office with Hamilton and Jefferson yelling in his face from both sides of the aisle. He received little support from either the Democrat-Republican Party or his own Federalist Party, and was ousted after one term (joining his son as the only two one-term presidents of the country’s first 50 years).

**Things He Can Brag About:**

- Being the first vice president
- Being the first president to live in the White House
- Opposing slavery before it was cool. One of the only pre-Civil War presidents to do so openly.
- Creating the Navy
- Inventing the tradition of fireworks on the Fourth of July
- Speaking seven languages

**Things He Hopes We Don’t Remember:**

- His passing of the Alien and Sedition Acts, which prevented people from criticizing the federal government, because he was sad everyone was yelling at him (it was repealed the year after he left office)

**Things He’s Annoyed About:**

- Having to follow George Washington, of all fucking people
- Being the second president and somehow managing to not end up on Mount Rushmore or any coins or bills
- His presidential nickname, “His Rotundity,” mocking his short, fatness

**Other Notable Facts: **

- He and Thomas Jefferson formed a decades-long pen pal relationship after their times in office, and both died the same day, on July 4, 1826—the country’s 50th anniversary.

**Last Words: **“Thomas Jefferson survives.” Kind of embarrassing to talk about another president in your last words.

**3) Thomas Jefferson**

[(L)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jefferson.png)

[![jefferson](../_resources/7d825a39508829784f0b25682cdef015.png)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jefferson.png)

**Presidency:** 1801 – 1809 **Lived:** 1743 – 1826 **Ranking:** 4/43
**Slave Owner? **Duh.

**His Deal: **A dignified, highly respected, possibly dickish member of the Virginia elite, Jefferson was profoundly intellectual and knew and did basically everything—on top of his political achievements, he spoke four languages, studied zoology, architecture, botany, religion, law, history, literature, and the violin, and invented both the swivel chair and the folding ladder. Jefferson was one of the major architects of the new country and founded an entire philosophy of governing followed by successors like Madison and Monroe.

**His Presidency: **He did some major things, most of them in his first term, like presiding over the outlawing of the importation of slaves (but owning and trading slaves inside the country were still okay) and sending Lewis and Clark out to explore the West. But his crowning achievement was acquiring the entire middle of the country from Napoleon’s France for $15 million ($234 million today, or 42 cents/acre) in the Louisiana Purchase:

[![National-atlas-1970-1810-loupurchase-1](../_resources/3e7e370b1cb910eea03cdd18998b2649.png)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/National-atlas-1970-1810-loupurchase-1.png)

**Things He Can Brag About:**

- Drafting the Declaration of Independence in his early 30s, about the same age some of us are when we’re drawing unimpressive stick figures on a blog instead
- Being on the nickel and Mount Rushmore
- Founding the University of Virginia

**Things He Hopes We Don’t Remember:**

- His fetish for owning hundreds of slaves and not freeing them ever
- That he knocked up his own slave, Sally Hemmings, who was actually 3/4 white and the half sister of his wife (his wife’s father had six kids with his own slave, of which Sally was one)

**Things He’s Annoyed About:**

- His wife saying, “Please don’t ever get remarried after I die” and then dying a second later. Jefferson was only 39 and had to go the next 44 years without a wife because of this, which was super annoying. Especially since his hypocritical wife had been a widow when she married him.
- Before marrying his wife, proposing to a woman named Rebecca Burwell and being rejected
- The fact that after he drafted the Declaration of Independence, it went before Congress for review, who made substantial changes to it, cutting it down by one fourth, which according to Jefferson, “mangled” what he had written
- John Adams thinking he and Jefferson were best friends and writing Jefferson 1,000 letters later in life that Jefferson had to respond to
- Being put on the $2 bill, the one small bill to go out of style

**Other Notable Facts: **

- He was Washington’s Secretary of State, but resigned from the cabinet after Washington kept siding with his rival Alexander Hamilton. Washington never forgave Jefferson and never spoke to him again.
- He hated making speeches, only making two during his eight years as president—his two inaugural addresses
- Jefferson learned about various European cuisines while traveling and brought his favorite back, introducing to the US ice cream, waffles, macaroni and cheese, and French Fries.
- He had a weird amount of pets. 2 dogs, 8 birds, 9 horses, and 2 live grizzly bears, which Louis and Clark (somehow) brought back for him from their expedition.

**Last Words: **“Is it the fourth yet?” This wasn’t his plan. He said his desired last words a few hours earlier:

*I have done for my country, and for all mankind, all that I could do, and I now resign my soul, without fear, to my God, – my daughter to my country. *

But then instead of dying like he was supposed to, he woke up one more time, forgot that he wasn’t supposed to talk, and asked the date. Then he died, and now his last words are forever, “Is it the fourth yet?”

**4) Alexander Hamilton**

[(L)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/a-hamilton-national-portrait-gallery.jpg)

No wait, he wasn’t a president, so stop thinking he was.
**4) James Madison**

[(L)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/madison.png)

[![madison](../_resources/e5a4c4ad8de043c356ab5ac1fadfd532.png)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/madison.png)

**Presidency:** 1809 – 1816 **Lived:** 1751 – 1836 **Ranking:** 13/43
**Slave Owner? **Yup. Owned hundreds.

**His Deal: **At an adorable 5’4″ and 100 pounds, Madison is our pixie president. His greatest achievements happened before his presidency, when he was considered the most influential thinker behind the drafting of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, granting him the nickname “Father of the Constitution.” He was then one of three authors of *The Federalist Papers*, a series of articles building support for ratification of the new Constitution.

**His Presidency: **He began his presidency continuing the policies of Thomas Jefferson, but soon got wrapped up in the hideous War of 1812 with Britain, which the US lost (there are differing views on this, and a bunch of commenters have suggested that the War of 1812 a tie. It depends whether you think the US was secretly trying to take Canada or not—if so, they lost).

**Things He Can Brag About:**

- Weighing under 100 pounds as a grown man, an unbelievable feat
- Being Thomas Jefferson’s Secretary of State and the one who actually negotiated the Louisiana Purchase
- According to my research, being the first president to wear long pants. Unclear what this means the previous three wore.

**Things He Hopes We Don’t Remember:**

- The fact that late in his life, after his presidency, he became obsessed with his legacy and paranoid to the point of altering letters he had written or others had written him

**Things He’s Annoyed About:**

- Being the only president to be physically driven out of the White House or shot at in war while being president (both by the British in the War of 1812)

**Other Notable Facts:**

- The Star Spangled Banner was written during his time in office

**Last Words: **“Nothing more than a change of mind, my dear. I always talk better lying down.” (In response to a niece asking him what was the matter)

*Page 2*
**5) James Monroe**
**Presidency:** 1817 – 1825 **Lived:** 1758 – 1831 **Ranking:** 14/43
**Slave Owner? **Yes.

**His Deal: **The last founding father to be president, he was rambunctious, arguing against the ratification of the Constitution, and one time being a brat to George Washington about stuff, which got him yelled at and sent to France as the new ambassador to think about what he had done.

**His Presidency: **Running nearly unopposed because the Federalist Party was in shambles, Monroe easily won the election and enjoyed a peaceful time while in office, cutely called “The Era of Good Feelings.” His presidency’s best-known accomplishment is the Monroe Doctrine, which states that from that point forward, if any imperialist European country tried to seize land from the United States or any other independent nation in the Western Hemisphere, the US would hit them in the face with bullets from their guns. He also bullied Spain into selling Florida to the US, which Monroe wanted because of Disney World.

**Things He Can Brag About:**

- Having held more offices than any other president, including senator, governor, Secretary of State, Secretary of War, and the ambassador to three countries
- Wanting to return American slaves to Africa, having created the nation of Liberia, and its capital being named Monrovia

**Things He Hopes We Don’t Remember:**

- The time he released his Consul to Tunis from his post because he found out he was Jewish
- The time he had a disagreement with his Treasury Secretary and acted calmly and rationally, chasing the Secretary out of the White House with a set of fire tongs

**Things He’s Annoyed About:**

- Everyone always talking about Adams and Jefferson dying on July 4th, but he died on July 4th too and no one cares
- With the opposing Federalist Party on life support, he ran unopposed in 1820 and was all excited to be the second president (after Washington) to receive 100% of the electoral votes when one dick elector voted for John Quincy Adams, who wasn’t even running

**Other Notable Facts:**

- He was the last president to wear the hilarious Founding Fathers powdered wig. This was so 20 years ago, and it earned him the nickname “The Last Cocked Hat.”
- He was broke and died with nothing

**Last Words: **“I regret that I should leave this world without again beholding him,” referring to James Madison. Madison commented that he was “creeped out by this.”

**6) John Quincy Adams**

[(L)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/quincy-adams.png)

[![quincy adams](../_resources/3e571588596780fcf857d199d588342a.png)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/quincy-adams.png)

**Presidency:** 1825 – 1829 **Lived:** 1767 – 1848 **Ranking:** 18/43
**Slave Owner? **No.

**His Deal: **Much like his father, John Quincy Adams was sharp, well-educated, outspoken, possibly annoying, and not really one of the cool kids. For someone who had a blah presidency, he had a great political career—excelling before his presidency as a renowned diplomat who wrote the Monroe Doctrine and after his presidency when he spent 17 years in Congress, during which he was a widely respected leader. He was best-known for his fervent anti-slavery views, and he is credited with inciting much of what became the North’s anti-slavery cause.

**His Presidency: **His presidency started in controversy, as he lost both the popular and the electoral vote to Andrew Jackson and only won the presidency because the margin was too narrow and it came down to a Congressional vote. This vote was deemed scandalous because Henry Clay, who surprised people by swinging favor to Adams and helping him win, was then made Adams’ Secretary of State. Adams started his presidency with lofty goals of modernizing the American economy and reforming education, and while he did get a few things done, including drastically lowering the national debt, Congress was controlled by followers of Jackson and they blocked Adams from doing most of what he wanted to do.

**Things He Can Brag About:**

- Joining his father as the *only *pre-Civil War presidents to have the guts to vocally oppose slavery. Many others were morally opposed but lacked the political courage to make it part of their identity.
- Being the first president to be photographed
- Predicting the specifics of the Civil War decades before it happened
- Being the only president who knew both the Founding Fathers and Abraham Lincoln
- Having a huge role in the movie *Amistad*
- Being great at pool

**Things He’s Annoyed About:**

- Falling in love twice, both times having the girl vetoed by his mom Abigail, and then finally getting approved to marry a woman he considered overbearing like his mother
- The time he had to do an interview naked. He and his stocky, round body enjoyed swimming nude in the freezing Potomac River every morning. One morning, a reporter stole his clothes while he was swimming and wouldn’t give them back until he did an interview. That probably couldn’t be pulled off today.
- Writing the whole Monroe Doctrine as Monroe’s Secretary of State, and getting no credit for this whatsoever

**Other Notable Facts:**

- He had a pet alligator. It lived in the White House bathtub.
- He slept from midnight to 4am each night.

**Last Words: **“This is the last of earth. I am content.”
**7) Andrew Jackson**

[(L)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jackson.png)

[![jackson](../_resources/b2bbfa3dbee0680d5896243cf4f421a9.png)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jackson.png)

**Presidency:** 1829 – 1837 **Lived:** 1767 – 1845 **Ranking:** 8/43
**Slave Owner? **Lots and lots.

**His Deal: **A tough old bastard, Andrew Jackson came from hard beginnings—his father died when he was a baby, his brother died of smallpox while they were prisoners of war together during the Revolutionary War as teenagers, and his mother died around the same time from cholera while helping to treat cholera patients. He was a notorious hothead, bordering on insane, and engaged in over 100 duels in his lifetime. As a general in the War of 1812, he earned the nickname “Old Hickory” by being “tough as old hickory” on the battlefield. His political philosophies gained a large number of followers, who for decades called themselves “Jacksonian Democrats.”

**His Presidency: **Jackson’s presidency was controversial, but very effective. On one hand, he was kind of a horrid White Supremacist, being a proponent of slavery and passing the Indian Removal Act, a policy that forced Native American communities westward, resulting in what’s called “The Trail of Tears” and thousands of deaths. On the other hand, he fought hard to protect popular democracy, was big on states’ rights, fought corruption, and managed to pay off the entire American debt during his term.

**Things He Can Brag About:**

- Having his silly long face on the $20 bill
- Being the founder of Memphis, Tennessee
- Having Jackson, Mississippi named after him

**Things He Hopes We Don’t Remember:**

- His conviction that the Earth was flat

**Things He’s Annoyed About:**

- Winning the popular and electoral votes in 1824 and losing anyway
- His forehead scar, which he got when he was 13, during the Revolutionary War, when he refused to clean a British soldier’s boots and the soldier slashed him

**Other Notable Facts:**

- He was born on the border of South and North Carolina, and both states claim him as theirs (he says he was born in South Carolina).
- Jackson had a lifelong cough because of a musket ball lodged permanently in his lung. Another time he was shot, he had the bullet removed without any anesthesia. Tough son of a bitch.
- One of his many duels was against Charles Dickinson, who had insulted Jackson’s wife in the newspaper. Jackson let Dickinson shoot first, and he shot Jackson in the chest. Jackson just rolled his eyes and shot Dickinson and killed him.
- He was the first president someone attempted to assassinate. The attempt failed, and legend has it that Jackson beat the perpetrator with his cane.
- He cursed like a sailor, and as a result, so did his pet parrot. This caused a lot of problems, including the parrot having to be removed from Jackson’s funeral ceremony for cursing so much during the proceedings.
- He was a red head before going gray by the start of his presidency.
- Because Jackson believed the White House belonged to the people, he invited the people in for a Party after his inauguration. They were unruly as fuck and Jackson had to sneak out the window and stay in a hotel.
- He was randomly loving, and adopted three sons, two of whom were Native Americans, and he and his wife were the legal guardians for eight more children.
- He was a frail dude, at 6’1″ and weighing around 130 pounds.
- By the time he took office, George Washington’s presidency was as far in the past as Eisenhower’s is today.
- [Here he is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:78yo_Andrew_Jackson.jpg) looking cranky at age 78.

**Last Words: **“I hope to meet you all in Heaven. Be good children, all of you, and strive to be ready when the change comes.”

**8) Martin Van Buren**
**Presidency:** 1837 – 1841 **Lived:** 1782 – 1862 **Ranking:** 24/43
**Slave Owner? **Yes, but only one (and his father owned six).

**His Deal: **At 5’6″, the “Little Magician” defined most his career as a passionate advocate for Jacksonian democracy and was one of the key organizers of the 19th century Democratic Party.

**His Presidency: **He used his time in office to try to continue the policies of Andrew Jackson, but his presidency ended up being swallowed up by an economic crisis called The Panic of 1837, and he was the scapegoat, being nicknamed “Van Ruin.” His situation was not helped by his decision to be elite in front of everyone during the crisis and drive around in the fanciest possible carriages. Not shockingly, he was a one-term president.

**Things He Can Brag About:**

- Being the first president to be born an American citizen
- Being the first president not of British origin (his family was Dutch) and first ESL president (his first language was Dutch)

**Things He Hopes We Don’t Remember:**

- The time he was 68 and asked a 40-year-old woman to marry him, and she said no.

**Other Notable Facts:**

- His hometown was Kinderhook, NY, and one of his campaign slogans was “Vote for Old Kinderhook,” or “Vote for OK.” The term OK caught on and it’s theorized that this could be the origin of the word “okay.”

**Last Words: **“There is but one reliance…” Shame he died before finishing the sentence, and now we’ll never know what the one reliance is.

**9) William Henry Harrison**

**Presidency:** 1841 – 1841 **Lived:** 1773 – 1841 **Ranking:** 38/43 – welcome to the beginning of the Bad President Circus!

**Slave Owner? **Yes.

**His Deal: **Like Andrew Jackson, William Henry Harrison did a lot of pretending to be a common man and a lot of actually being from an extremely wealthy slave-owning family. He was a renowned general in the War of 1812, one of the major reasons he was thereafter a viable presidential candidate. He was the first Whig president.

**His Presidency: **He started things off with a bang, giving the longest ever inaugural address for two hours. Then he got pneumonia and perished. That was his presidency.

**Things He Can Brag About:**

- Being the only US president to have attended medical school

**Things He Hopes We Don’t Remember:**

- The time he was supposedly morally opposed to slavery, but also owned a bunch of slaves, had six kids with one of them, and fought to legalize slavery in the Northwest of the country to encourage settlement there.

**Things He’s Annoyed About:**

- Dying 30 days into his presidency, a development which impinged upon his ability to rule effectively

**Other Notable Facts:**

- He at one point started making and selling whiskey, but then he realized that whiskey got people drunk, was appalled at himself, and stopped.
- He’s the grandfather to future president Benjamin Harrison.
- He was nicknamed Old Tippecanoe after his heroics in the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811, and nicknamed WillyH2 203 years later just now by me.

**Last Words: **“Sir, I wish you to understand the true principles of the government. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more.” This would have been such a nice sign-off had it been directed at his successor, John Tyler. Unfortunately, he said this to his doctor.

**10) John Tyler**

**Presidency:** 1841 – 1845 **Lived:** 1790 – 1862 **Ranking:** 36/43
**Slave Owner? **Yes, another slave-owning president.

**His Deal: **A Democrat disenchanted with the Jacksonian loyalists in his party, he was chosen by the opposing party, the Whigs, as William Henry Harrison’s running mate in order to help attract other disaffected Democrats. He was then suddenly the president when Harrison died 30 days into his term. Historians are wholly unimpressed with Tyler, citing his political resolve as one of the only positives of his legacy.

**His Presidency: **His presidency started in controversy, as the existing Constitution didn’t really have instructions for what to do when a president dies in office (not sure how they could have left this out). It was eventually deemed that Tyler was officially the president, and he began his time in office by ditching the Whigs and Harrison’s existing platform and going rogue with his policies. This turned his own party angrily against him (they called him “His Accidency”), but the opposing Democrats also hated what he was doing, so he was called “a president without a party.” Sounds fun in theory, but the end result was him getting basically nothing done in office and going down as one of history’s worst presidents.

A strong believer in the convenient principle of “manifest destiny,” (i.e. we British descendants are destined to expand ourselves throughout this whole land), about halfway through his term, he became fixated on the goal of acquiring the Republic of Texas. He all but closed the deal, and his efforts set up the next president (Polk) to finish the job.

**Things He Can Brag About:**

- As the governor of Virginia, giving Thomas Jefferson’s funeral address at the age of 36

**Things He Hopes We Don’t Remember:**

- That late in his life, he joined the Confederate Party and was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives, making him the only president to be a sworn enemy of the US

**Things He’s Annoyed About:**

- The Princeton Disaster, when Tyler and his cabinet members were on a ceremonial cruise and a huge naval gun aboard the ship fired a celebratory shot—only it malfunctioned and exploded on the boat, killing off much of Tyler’s cabinet. The scene looked like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Explosion_aboard_USS_Princeton.jpg).

**Other Notable Facts:**

    - He was a prolific impregnator, having 15 children with two wives.
    - He currently has two living grandchildren, who are ages 85 and 89.
    - Tyler is the great uncle of Harry Truman.
    - His wife died of a stroke one year into his presidency, making her the first First Lady to die in the White House. Tyler, 53, then married a 23-year-old (making him the first president to get married while in office).
    - Julia Tyler, his new wife, began the tradition of having *[Hail to the Chief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC837oh98_Y)* played when the president entered the room at state functions.

**Last Words: **“I am going. Perhaps it is best.”

**11) James Polk**

[(L)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/polk.png)

[![polk](../_resources/138a57de462494336682de9274bbcafd.png)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/polk.png)

**Presidency:** 1845 – 1849 **Lived:** 1775 – 1849 **Ranking:** 10/43
**Slave Owner?** Yes.

**His Deal: **A Good President Island in the middle of The Bad President Circus, Polk is the least known good president by far. He was a Congressman by age 29, a supporter of Andrew Jackson, and a great orator, known as “Napoleon of the Stump.”

**His Presidency: **Emerging in 1845 as an unlikely dark horse election-winner, Polk was a rare promise-keeping and efficient president. He began by announcing that he would only seek one term in office, and followed by laying out a clear, ambitious agenda—re-establish an independent Treasury, reduce tariffs, and acquire a bunch of Western land. Then he spent his one term taking no vacations, accomplishing his full agenda, and didn’t run again. Weird, right?

As for acquiring Western land, he started by finishing Tyler’s Texas mission, which turned into tensions that quickly led to the Mexican-American War. The US was bigger and stronger and bullied Mexico into giving up about half of their country for the paltry fee of $15 million. He also used the threat of war to force Britain into a compromise that landed the US with the whole Pacific Northwest. Here’s how big an impact Polk had—he locked down the blue Texas region, and acquired both the pink Southwest region in the war and the yellow Northwest region from Britain:

**Things He Can Brag About:**

- Being the only US president to have also served as Speaker of the House
- Making the US a huge, coast-to-coast nation

**Things He Hopes We Don’t Remember:**

- That Mexico has feelings too. Most Americans are thankful to Polk for his westward expansion, but he could just as easily be considered a brutal imperialist invader.

**Things He’s Annoyed About: **

- Being considered by everyone as “one of those old random presidents,” even though he was actually really good and should be much more famous.
- His attempt to acquire Cuba, to which the Spanish said no. (It would be weird if Cuba were a US state today.)

**Other Notable Facts:**

- Polk was president during the gold rush in California.
- He was one of three presidents who had no children.
- He died of cholera three months after leaving office.

**Last Words: **“I love you, Sarah. For all eternity, I love you.” How annoyed are all the previous presidents that they didn’t think of that one.

**12) Zachary Taylor**

[(L)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/taylor.png)

[![taylor](../_resources/ddede4da1ac35567a4a4719badd198c6.png)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/taylor.png)

**Presidency:** 1849 – 1850 **Lived:** 1784 – 1850 **Ranking:** 35/43
**Slave Owner? **He owned a bunch of things and one of them was slaves.

**His Deal: **A rad old war hero, both as a captain in the War of 1812 and as a general in the Mexican-American War. Unfortunately, he wasn’t much of a political leader, with vague and unknown opinions in many major policy areas, including the hottest issue, slavery. He aligned with the Whigs a bit more than the Democrats, so he ran as a Whig, and won.

**His Presidency: **Was short. He died suddenly after eating some raw fruit, about a year into his presidency. Historians have speculated that he may have been poisoned, but there’s no conclusive evidence either way.

**Things He Can Brag About:**

- Having a rad nickname only a war veteran could have—Old Rough and Ready
- That Abraham Lincoln gave his eulogy

**Things He Hopes We Don’t Remember:**

- That he was on his way to being a pretty terrible president, but died quickly enough that no one really knows for sure

**Things He’s Annoyed About:**

- Being poisoned, if that’s what happened

**Other Notable Facts:**

- He fell in sharp contrast to all the super-intellectual and polished-politician presidents of the time—he never went to school, had no political experience, never voted in his life, and dressed like a farmer.
- His handwriting was later described as “that of a near illiterate.”

**Last Words: **“I am about to die. I expect the summons very soon. I have tried to discharge all my duties faithfully. I regret nothing, but I am sorry that I am about to leave my friends.”

**13) Millard Fillmore**

[(L)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fillmore.png)

[![fillmore](../_resources/e879187c793ef1da03c62010f219eab6.png)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fillmore.png)

**Presidency:** 1850 – 1853 **Lived:** 1800 – 1874 **Ranking:** 38/43
**Slave Owner? **No.

**His Deal: **The Vice President that took over for Taylor after his death. Fillmore was chosen as VP in order to satisfy Northerners—he was middle class, from New York, and had never owned slaves. His time in office was the last Whig presidency, and in his later years, he ran for president (and lost) as the head of the new American, or Know-Nothing Party. Fillmore was an impressive lawyer and turned out to be a much-less-impressive leader of the country.

**His Presidency: **An anti-slavery moderate, Fillmore was yet another president with a weak stance on slavery. He came into power in the heat of the slavery battle and proposed The Compromise of 1850, which momentarily quieted tensions, successfully kicking the can down the road. One interesting achievement of his presidency was commissioning the Perry Expedition to try to open up isolationist Japan, which triggered Japan’s new path toward becoming a powerful, modern nation.

**Things He Can Brag About:**

- In his lawyer life, starting a firm which still exists today as the large firm Hodgson Russ

**Things He Hopes We Don’t Remember:**

- He was morally against slavery, but that didn’t stop him from allowing slavery to exist in newly-gained Western territories, signing the Fugitive Act (which demanded that slaves that escaped to free states be returned to their owners), and down the road, opposing the Emancipation Proclamation.
- His unbelievably lame nickname, The Compromise President

**Other Notable Facts:**

- The only president named Millard
- The only human being named Millard

**Last Words: **“The nourishment is palatable” after being fed some soup. He finished his life by saying, “The nourishment is palatable.” Typical Millard Fillmore.

**14) Franklin Pierce**

[(L)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/pierce.png)

[![pierce](../_resources/8237222435508ae958c598f4e80f1554.png)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/pierce.png)

**Presidency:** 1853 – 1857 **Lived:** 1804 – 1869 **Ranking:** 40/43
**Slave Owner? **No.

**His Deal: **Franklin Pierce was good at some things, like law and fishing. He was also bad at some things, like being the president. Shame, because the country really could have used a good president right around the mid-1850s, when the nation was on the brink of going to war with itself. He did fine in politics in earlier years as a handsome and charming senator from New Hampshire, taking that seat at the age of 32.

**His Presidency: **In fairness, Pierce began his presidency in a tough spot. He, his wife, and his son were in a train crash that killed his son right in front of him and his wife (this after they had already lost their first two children). Then, a couple months later, William Rufus King, his vice president, died. Once in office, he followed the lead of the last six presidents by taking a middling position on slavery that left everyone unhappy. Most of his policy decisions were the result of persuasion by his cabinet-members, the worst example of which was his being manipulated into passing the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which opened up the possibility of slavery expanding westward into those new territories—this infuriated the Northerners and brought war even closer. A terrible president, not only did he not win reelection in 1857, he didn’t even win the nomination for reelection by his own party.

**Things He Can Brag About:**

- Completing the Gadsden Purchase, which bought the final piece of land to complete the modern continental US (see map in the Polk section—it’s the small reddish section at the bottom of Arizona)
- Being the first president to present his inaugural address with no notes

**Things He Hopes We Don’t Remember:**

- The time he drunk drove his horse carriage into an old woman, running over her with the horse. I feel like that should be considered both Pierce’s and the horse’s fault equally
- The fact that he was caught supporting the Confederacy. During the Civil War, Confederate President Jefferson Davis’s home was captured and raided by the Union army. One thing they found were letters from Pierce to Davis, revealing Pierce’s Confederate sympathies.

**Things He’s Annoyed About:**

- His opponents’ nickname for him, “Fainting Frank,” mocking his wartime efforts in the Mexican-American War, referring to a time when he fainted during battle and had to be carried away

**Other Notable Facts:**

- He ran for president against his own commanding officer from the Mexican-American War.
- The Democrats’ campaign slogan during that election was, “The Democrats will *pierce* their enemies in 1852 as they *poked* them in 1844.”
- During the campaign, opponents mocked Pierce for rumors of his alcoholism, calling him “the hero of many a well-fought bottle”
- He was highly over it by the time his presidency ended, quoted as saying, “All that’s left, is to drink and die.”

**15) James Buchanan**

[(L)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/buchanan.png)

[![buchanan](../_resources/e451381f0b36b2969f6f49fb3792e7c0.png)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/buchanan.png)

**Presidency:** 1857 – 1861 **Lived:** 1791 – 1868 **Ranking:** 42/43
**Slave Owner? **No.

**His Deal: **You’d think that when the previous three consecutive presidents score 35th, 38th, and 40th out of 43, we could only go up from there. You’d really think that. And yet, James Buchanan is the next in line and the lowest-ranked of all the presidents so far, at 42nd. The funny thing is that Buchanan’s history shows that upon entering office, he had hoped and expected to be a president on par with George Washington, one who would bring harmony to the divided nation. He thought he was gonna be Abraham Lincoln. Unfortunately for James Buchanan, he wasn’t Abraham Lincoln, he was James Buchanan.

**His Presidency: **A debacle. Buchanan’s four years were insanely tense and rocky, with Civil War furor bubbling over and an economic crisis—the Panic of 1857—not helping the situation. And Buchanan couldn’t have handled things worse. By trying to kick the can even further down the road and maintain a fragile peace, Buchanan alienated both sides of the fight. He was especially annoyed with the Northern abolitionists, since if they would just *let it go*, this huge nightmare might just go away. But they didn’t let it go, and in 1860, South Carolina and six other slave states seceded from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America. Buchanan replied by saying, “Ugh,” and by staying ambiguous enough in his actions that he impressively managed to continue to infuriate both sides. When that didn’t work, he tried paralysis, and did nothing—and the Civil War broke out. Historians often cite Buchanan’s ambiguity in the face of secession to be the #1 worst decision by a US president.

**Things He Can Brag About:**

- Being the only US president from Pennsylvania

**Things He Hopes We Don’t Remember: **

- His presidency
- The fact that even without all the slavery/war stuff, he’d still probably be the worst president—his cabinet was the most corrupt in history, he vetoed a bill to create more colleges, saying that “there are already too many educated people,” he ran the deficit up to $17 million and presided over the Panic of 1857, he recklessly ousted Brigham Young as governor of the Utah Territory after hearing uncorroborated reports of a Mormon rebellion, he vetoed the Morrill Act and Homestead Act, both of which proved to be important acts after Lincoln later signed them into law.

**Things He’s Annoyed About:**

- All of this. He spent the rest of his life fiercely defending himself, and the day before his death, he predicted that “history will vindicate my memory.”

**Other Notable Facts:**

- A lifelong bachelor, some believe that Buchanan was homosexual. He spent ten years living with Pierce’s VP, William Rufus King (the one who died before Pierce started as president), leading to snide remarks from some, including cranky old Andrew Jackson, who referred to Buchanan and King as “Miss Nancy and Aunt Fancy.”
- We’ll save him for a future post, but the fact that Buchanan is only considered the *second *worst president does not say good things about Warren G. Harding.

**Last Words: **“Whatever the result may be, I shall carry to my grave the consciousness that at least I meant well for my country. Oh Lord God Almighty, as thou wilt.” Well that was sad. Great, I feel bad now.

**16) Abraham Lincoln**

[(L)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/lincoln.png)

[![lincoln](:/18814e29c124a5d8a4229f55ac7fae61)](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/lincoln.png)

**Presidency:** 1861 – 1865 **Lived:** 1809 – 1865 **Ranking:** 1/43
**Slave Owner? **Clearly not.

**His Deal: **A refreshing #1 ranking in the heart of The Bad President Circus, this was perfect timing. Lincoln was raised in a one-room cabin, lost his mother and sister when he was young, went to one year of school total, and had to educate himself by borrowing books. He self-taught his way all the way to passing the bar at age 27.

He was an astute politician, winning people over with his eloquence and self-deprecation, especially with regard to his appearance—once when called “two-faced” during a debate, he replied, “If I had two faces, do you think I’d be wearing this one?”

Lincoln ran for Senate in Illinois in 1858 against Stephen Douglas, engaging in the famous Lincoln-Douglas debates on slavery during the campaign. Douglas won the election, but Lincoln had the debates made into a book, which spread throughout the country and won him national support, paving the way to his presidential election two years later.

I was wondering if maybe Lincoln was slightly overrated with that first place ranking, but then I read about him for two hours just now and no, he’s not.

**His Presidency: **Lincoln took office right as the Civil War was breaking out and had all kinds of shit to deal with. He had to use a slew of complex legal maneuvers to pass the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment (outlawing slavery), and a whole array of clever human manipulation tricks to gain the support he needed for his agenda from politicians and the public. He even played a large role in the war strategy. Five years into his presidency, the Confederacy surrendered, ending the war, and six days later, he was assassinated, since apparently there’s no need for anyone to guard the president’s box while he’s watching a play.

**Things He Can Brag About:**

- Being on the penny and the $5 bill
- Being the first Republican president (though both of today’s parties claim Lincoln as theirs)
- Being the first bearded president—legend has it that an 11-year-old girl wrote to him during his presidential campaign and told him his weird skinny face should have a beard to be less weird and skinny, and he took the advice
- Being the tallest president, at 6’4″ (and a frail 180 pounds)
- Delivering the Gettysburg Address while having smallpox
- Creating the first US income tax by signing the Revenue Act of 1861
- Making Thanksgiving a national and annual holiday. Before this, Thanksgiving happened rarely and sporadically, the last one having taken place 50 years earlier, during James Madison’s presidency

**Things He Hopes We Don’t Remember:**

- That he and his wife conducted regular séances in the White House to contact their dead sons

**Things He’s Annoyed About:**

- The nickname Abe. He never liked it.

**Other Notable Facts:**

- Lincoln’s spouse, Mary Todd Lincoln, went insane after enduring Lincoln’s death and then the third death of one of their sons a few years later. Their one remaining son, Robert, had her institutionalized.

**Last Words: **“Haha.” He reportedly was laughing at a line in the play when he was shot.
