Data Warehouse Built for the Cloud | Snowflake | No Limits

# Snowflake** Data Warehouse**

## The only data warehouse

**built for the cloud**

Conventional [data warehouses](https://www.snowflake.com/data-warehousing-glossary/data-warehousing/) and big data solutions struggle to deliver on their fundamental purpose: to make it easy to amass all your data, enable rapid analytics, and derive data-driven insights for all your business users.

To solve that, we built a new SQL data warehouse from the ground up for the cloud. It’s designed with a [patented new architecture](http://www.snowflake.com/product/architecture/) to handle all aspects of data and analytics. The result? A data warehouse that delivers the performance, simplicity, concurrency and affordability not possible with other data warehouses.

### Snowflake Overview

Snowflake will change the way you think about data warehousing. Watch this short video to learn how a unique approach and architecture allow Snowflake to address the [challenges](http://www.snowflake.com/challenges-and-new-opportunities-in-data-analytics/) of today’s [data and analytics](http://www.snowflake.com/use-cases/data-analytics-applications/).

-

### Complete SQL Data Warehouse

Snowflake is a fully relational ANSI SQL data warehouse, so you can leverage the skills and tools your organization already uses. Updates, deletes, analytical functions, transactions, stored procedures, materialized views and complex joins give you the full capabilities you need to make the most of your data.

-

### Zero Management

Snowflake eliminates the administration and management demands of traditional data warehouses and big data platforms. Snowflake is a true data warehouse-as-a-service running in the cloud. With built-in performance, there’s no infrastructure to manage or knobs to turn. Snowflake automatically handles infrastructure, optimization, availability, data protection and more so you can focus on using your data, not managing it.

-

### Diverse Data

Snowflake can support all of your business data, whether from traditional sources or newer machine-generated sources, without requiring cumbersome transformations and tradeoffs. Snowflake’s patented technology natively loads and optimizes both structured and semi-structured data such as JSON, Avro, or XML and makes it available via SQL without sacrificing performance or flexibility.

-

### Compelling Performance

Snowflake processes queries and tasks in a fraction of the time conventional on-premises and cloud data warehouses require Our columnar database engine uses advanced optimizations, including automatic clustering, which removes the headache of manually re-clustering data when loading new data into a table. Combined with the capacity to scale up and down, automatically and on the fly, you get the exact performance you need, exactly when you need it.

-

### Any Scale of Data, Workloads, and Users

Snowflake’s patented multi-cluster, shared [data architecture](https://www.snowflake.com/product/architecture/) separates storage and compute, making it possible to scale up and down on-the-fly without downtime or disruption. Automatically scale to support any amount of data, workloads and concurrent users and applications without requiring data movement, data marts or data copies.

-

### Failover and Business Continuity

Replicate data across cloud regions, across cloud providers, keep data and apps where they are, operate confidently with failover and business continuity.

### Broad Ecosystem

You can rapidly integrate Snowflake with custom and packaged [tools and applications](https://www.snowflake.com/partners/). Our native and standards-based connectors including ODBC, JDBC, Javascript, Python, Spark, R, and Node.js unlock the power of cloud data warehousing for developers and tools that use a variety of languages and frameworks.

-

### Pay Only for What You Use

Usage-based pricing for compute and storage means you only pay for the amount of data you store and the amount of compute processing you use. Say goodbye to upfront costs, over-provisioned systems or idle clusters consuming money.

[See Pricing](http://www.snowflake.com/pricing/)

-

### Seamlessly Share Data Across your Organization and Beyond

Snowflake’s multi-tenant architecture extends the data warehouse to the Data Sharehouse, with governed and secure, modern data sharing in real time. Within minutes, and without ever having to move data, share any slice of your data across your organization or with any of your business partners and customers. With Snowflake Data Sharing, you can easily forge one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many data sharing relationships.
