### Automate responsive breakpoints generation

You can use [Cloudinary's API](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images) to upload your images to the cloud and automatically generate breakpoints programmatically:

- [Ruby on Rails](https://responsivebreakpoints.com/#tab1)

- [Node.js](https://responsivebreakpoints.com/#tab2)

- [PHP](https://responsivebreakpoints.com/#tab3)

- [Python](https://responsivebreakpoints.com/#tab4)

 ``Cloudinary`::`Uploader`.upload(`"sample.jpg", `[[NEWLINE]]```responsive_breakpoints`: { `create_derived`: `true`, `bytes_step`: `20000`, `min_width`: `200`, `max_width`: `1000`, `transformation`: { `crop`: `:fill`, `aspect_ratio`: `"16:9"`, `gravity`: `:auto` } } )`

This [open source tool](https://github.com/cloudinary/responsive_breakpoints_generator) enables you to interactively generate responsive image breakpoints. However, for applications that involve user generated content of images dynamically uploaded to your site, you may want to streamline the breakpoints generation process.
