#### Support

We believe that a healthy ecosystem is important for the sustainability of open source for all.

### 2,000 Projects and Counting

At Google, we’ve always used open source to innovate. We want to give something back; we enjoy being a part of the community. We often release code to push the industry forward or share best practices we developed. But sometimes, it's just fun and interesting code. The list of projects we've released and contribute to is long and continues to grow.
