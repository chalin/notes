### Powerful

Stockfish is one of the strongest chess engines in the world. It is also much stronger than the best human chess grandmasters.

### Open Source

Unlike most chess engines, Stockfish is open source (GPL license). That means you can read the code, modify it, contribute back, and even use it in your own projects.
