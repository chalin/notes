1.  Canada

A northern neighbor is a world to explore.

Canada is huge — the second-largest country by area. It’s also a world unto itself, with cosmopolitan cities, barely explored natural wonders and everything in between. And this is the year to visit: In honor of the 150th anniversary of its confederation, when the original colonies came together as one country, Canada is rolling out the welcome mat. All of the country’s[more than 200 national parks and historic sites](http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/voyage-travel/admission.aspx) are offering free admission through the year, from the turquoise lakes and mountain peaks of Banff in Alberta to the rolling dunes and red sandstone cliffs of Prince Edward Island along the Atlantic Coast to the newest reserve, the glacial-rounded[Mealy Mountains](http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/nl/mealy/index.aspx) in Labrador. Meanwhile, in the capital, Ottawa, a[full year of celebration is planned](http://www.ottawa2017.ca/); more events will be on offer in Montreal,[which turns 375](http://www.375mtl.com/en/). And did we mention the exchange rate? A weak Canadian dollar means American travelers get more for their money. So 2017 offers an ideal time to go north. — Remy Scalza

2.  Atacama Desert, Chile

New ways to explore the world’s highest desert.

The Atacama draws adventure seekers and stargazers to its vast, otherworldly landscape of wind-carved dunes and kaleidoscopic salt lakes. [Sunrise balloon rides](http://www.easternsafaris.com/balloonsoveratacama_home/), which started in August, reveal its staggering beauty from above. The luxurious, recently renovated [Explora Atacama](https://www.explora.com/hotels-and-travesias/atacama-hotel/) hotel reopened in December; overnight rates include guided desert excursions and nighttime access to the hotel’s on-site observatory, equipped with one of Chile’s largest privately-owned telescopes. — Arabella Bowen

3.  Agra, India

Beyond the Taj Mahal, new attractions beckon.

Navigating the stunning, sprawling Taj Mahal will get easier when an orientation center opens this year, but 2017 also promises new reasons to venture beyond: Nearby streets have been [repaved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-uuYTnroW4); the Agra Pavilion, a glass-walled dining complex, will host more than a dozen vendors and restaurants; and the [Mughal Museum](http://www.davidchipperfield.co.uk/project/mughal_museum), a collaboration with the architect David Chipperfield and [Studio Archohm](http://www.archohm.com/), has broken ground. In addition, [India’s fastest train](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Now-Delhi-Agra-at-160-km/hr-on-Gatimaan-Express/articleshow/51693596.cms) and [longest expressway](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/8-iaf-jets-land-on-agra-lucknow-expressway/articleshow/55541284.cms) now cut travel time from Delhi and Lucknow. — Ratha Tep

Riding a lift above Zermatt.  Drew Gardner for The New York Times

4.  Zermatt, Switzerland

New reasons to get close to the Matterhorn.

Zermatt, neighbor to the legendary Matterhorn, has been luring active travelers since 1898, when the [Gornergrat](https://www.gornergratbahn.ch/en) train — Switzerland’s first electric cog rail — began operating. In time for the rail’s 200th anniversary, the five-star [Riffelalp Resort](http://www.riffelalp.com/en/news#Rooms%202016), on the edge of a 7,290-foot-high plateau facing the Matterhorn, reopened in December with updated rooms and ski-in and ski-out access. Higher up, at Riffelberg, a permanent [open-air theater](http://freilichtspiele-zermatt.ch/) will open this summer with performances of “Romeo and Juliet on Gornergrat.” — Erin Levi

Lion cubs in the Duba Plains.  João Silva/The New York Times

5.  Botswana

Old lions, new digs in the heart of the Okavango.

If you’ve seen an African wildlife documentary in the last 30 years, chances are good that the filmmakers Dereck and Beverly Joubert had a hand in it. This spring the Jouberts, National Geographic explorers in residence, along with the company Great Plains Conservation, will open [Duba Plains Camp](http://greatplainsconservation.com/duba-plains-camp/), a luxury tented camp in a private 77,000-acre portion of the Okavango Delta that’s rife with lions, elephants and species specific to northern Botswana like the red lechwe. Expect safaris on boats with built-in camera mounts (when water levels allow) and a chance to see the descendants of Ma di Tau, the star of “The Last Lions.” — Tim Neville

6.  Dubrovnik, Croatia

New ways to enjoy a gem on the Dalmatian Coast.

With its limestone-paved streets and 80-foot-high walls surrounding Old Town, this star of the Dalmatian Coast has long been able to rest on its aesthetic laurels — you might recognize it as King’s Landing on “Game of Thrones.” In recent years, though, it has been adding to the luster. This summer, the city is starting an electric-scooter sharing program, allowing for locals and visitors to zip up and down the coast to more private beaches. The four-star beachside[Hotel Kompas](http://www.adriaticluxuryhotels.com/en/hotel-kompas-dubrovnik) is a comfy addition to the scene, and the long-awaited renovation of the grande dame[Hotel Excelsior](http://www.adriaticluxuryhotels.com/en/hotel-excelsior-dubrovnik) will be finished in June. The new restaurant[Portrait](http://www.portrait.hr/en/restaurant) is serving elevated takes on Dalmatian fare in Old Town. — David Farley

7.  Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming

A total solar eclipse amid natural splendor.

On Aug. 21, the continental United States will experience a [total solar eclipse](https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEmono/TSE2017/TSE2017.html) for the first time in 38 years. The eclipse will cut a diagonal swath across America, but city lights and overcast skies can be obstacles to prime viewing. A good bet is [Grand Teton](https://www.nps.gov/grte/index.htm) in Wyoming, which will get a generous two minutes and 20 seconds of darkness. If you miss the eclipse, you’ll still be surrounded by the jagged peaks, mountain lakes and wildlife of a pristine national park in its summer glory. — Elisabeth Eaves

8.  Tijuana, Mexico

Trading an unsavory reputation for a great food scene.

Though still rough around the edges, this fast-growing border town is on the rise, with a luxury condo boom and a new $60 million bus rapid transit system. Tijuana is also having a culinary renaissance, fueled by craft breweries, stylish coffee shops and globally informed restaurants that range from[Telefónica Gastro Park’s](http://facebook.com/TelefonicaGastroPark) hipster food trucks to bustling Baja Med spots like[La Querencía](http://www.laquerenciatj.com/) in the riverside Zona Río neighborhood. — Chaney Kwak

9.  Detroit, Michigan

A comeback city set to make good on its promise.

Detroit’s revitalization, after its 2013 bankruptcy filing, has long been building. In 2015, it was named a Unesco City of Design. But 2017 may be the year promise becomes reality. The new[QLine](http://m-1rail.com/) streetcar is expected to open in April, connecting the central Woodward Avenue corridor some 3.3 miles between downtown and the revived New Center area. It passes through Midtown, home to the[Detroit Institute of Arts](http://www.dia.org/), and the entertainment-focused[District Detroit](http://www.districtdetroit.com/), where a stadium opening this fall will be shared by the Detroit Red Wings and, in a return from the suburbs, the Detroit Pistons. — Elaine Glusac

The Warehouse District.  Andreas Meichsner for The New York Times

10.  Hamburg, Germany

A haven for architecture and design.

Zaha Hadid’s meandering promenade along the Elbe recently breathed new life into the riverfront and the nearby 19th-century Warehouse District, which made the Unesco World Heritage list in 2015. Adding to the sheen, the much-anticipated Herzog & de Meuron-designed[Elbphilharmonie](https://www.elbphilharmonie.de/en) is scheduled to open this month. The 360-foot-tall glass structure sits atop an old warehouse, its spiky roof evoking sails and the city’s maritime past. And if all that architectural gawking tires you out, the uber-luxurious[Fontenay](http://www.thefontenay.de/en/) will open later this year, the first five-star hotel in this northern German city in 18 years. — David Farley

11.  Marrakesh, Morocco

Art at a legendary designer’s spiritual resting place.

A new museum dedicated to the work of the fashion icon Yves Saint Laurent will debut this fall in Marrakesh, showcasing thousands of sketches, couture garments and accessories. The 43,000-square-foot structure sits adjacent to the [Jardin Majorelle](http://jardinmajorelle.com/ang/), which will celebrate its 60th anniversary as a public garden in 2017 (Saint Laurent saved it from demolition). The much-visited attraction also houses a [museum](http://jardinmajorelle.com/ang/introduction-to-berber-culture/) dedicated to Berber culture and the designer’s private residence, [Villa Oasis](http://jardinmajorelle.com/ang/yves-saint-laurent-and-pierre-berge-bought-the-garden-out-in-1980/). — Nora Walsh

13.  Pedregal, Ecuador

A natural beauty that’s still natural — for now.

The earthquake that rattled Ecuador last year mostly shattered areas where international travelers seldom go. Now man-made threats may compromise El Pedregal, a popular place for visitors before or after Galápagos excursions. The valley south of Quito is surrounded by huge volcanoes and grassy steppes where [haciendas](http://www.tierradelvolcan.com/)serve as bases for travelers to go hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding. Go before June to see the valley before new power lines encroach on condors and views. — Tim Neville

14.  Penzance, England

A glimpse of ‘Poldark’ country.

Penzance, the Cornish port town in the southwest of England, is having a moment, thanks to the popularity of “Poldark,” the BBC costume drama set in 18th-century Cornwall. The new [Chapel House](http://chapelhousepz.co.uk/) B&B joins a local favorite, the [Artists Residence](http://artistresidencecornwall.co.uk/), while restaurants such as the [Tolcarne Inn](http://tolcarneinn.co.uk/), in nearby Newlyn, and t[he Shore](http://theshorerestaurant.uk/) have put Penzance on the map as a culinary destination. Perhaps the best thing to see in Penzance — aside from the scenery — is the Art Deco-inspired [Jubilee pool](https://www.jubileepool.co.uk/), one of Europe’s last saltwater lidos. The enormous triangular public pool was built in the 1930s and just underwent a $3.73 million renovation. — David Shaftel

15.  Osaka, Japan

The ultimate Japanese feast awaits.

If Kyoto represents Japan’s spirit, and Tokyo its heart, Osaka is the country’s insatiable appetite. The city’s culinary legacy is alive and at work in the neighborhoods of Tsuruhashi and Fukushima, and in the 91 Michelin-starred restaurants spread throughout the city — like Ajikitcho, specializing in traditional Japanese cooking, and Taian, with a chargrilled focus. On April 28, it will all come together at the [International Festival Utage](http://www.intex-osaka.com/en/guest/event/single.php?id=471) (“feast”), a 10-day food festival, celebrating flavors from Japan’s 47 prefectures. — Kenan Christiansen

Scandinavia need not be a wallet-buster.

Free state-owned museums will make visits to Sweden’s capital less expensive in 2017. Over a dozen dropped their hefty entry fees last year, including the [Museum of Modern Art](http://modernamuseet.se/), the [Museum of Natural History](http://nrm.se/), the [Swedish History Museum](http://historiska.se/) and [Skokloster Castle](http://skoklostersslott.se/). Add to that a favorable exchange rate for Americans — the krona is about 20 percent weaker against the dollar than it was two years ago — and this beautiful city suddenly looks even more attractive. — Ingrid K.

A haven for spiritual seekers, soon more accessible.

With its first airport opening this year and its first rail link in the works, the remote northeastern Indian state of Sikkim keeps getting closer. Adventurous souls can trek Khangchendzonga National Park, a Himalayan haven of forests, valleys and mountains — including the world’s third-highest peak — that earned Unesco World Heritage status this year. Spiritual seekers, meanwhile, can pursue nirvana around the historically Buddhist land, from centuries-old Buddhist monasteries like Tashiding and Pemayangtse to the museum-like [Namgyal Institute of Tibetology](http://tibetology.net/). And load up on spices, fruits and vegetables. Sikkim became the first fully organic state in India last year. — Seth Sherwood

Plage, pétanque, pastis: parfait.

Only 10 minutes by ferry from the mainland, this four-mile-long under-the-radar Mediterranean island is an unexplored refuge with mountain-biking trails, sandy beaches and a single rustic vineyard offering free daily wine tastings. Mostly national parkland, the car-free island has one idyllic village where you’ll hear the clinking of both pétanque boules and glasses of pastis. The place to stay is [Le Mas du Langoustier](http://langoustier.com/), an upscale hotel perched between two coves on the western end of the island. — Ingrid K. Williams

19.  Madagascar

An island nation re-emerges as an ecotourism paradise.

Madagascar has stabilized since its elections in 2013 and is luring tourists back to its stunning combination of jungles, beaches and reefs. Lemurs and chameleons are just the headline attractions in this island nation the size of France, which lies off the east coast of Africa. Whale sharks and humpbacks cruise the undersea world, fat-trunked baobab trees dot the land, and more than 90 percent of the island’s mammals are not found anywhere else. Eco-friendly lodging options include luxurious island retreats like the new [Miavana](http://www.timeandtideafrica.com/miavana) and rain forest camps like [Masoala Forest Lodge](http://www.masoalaforestlodge.com/). And it’s not as hard to get to as you might imagine: Air France and South African Airways offer one-stop flights from New York. — Elisabeth Eaves

Take in old-school reggae at the [One World Ska and Rocksteady Music Festival](https://www.facebook.com/oneworldska/), launched this November; at the newly opened [Peter Tosh Museum](https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/nov/07/peter-tosh-museum-kingston-jamaica-reggae-legend), honoring the former Wailer; or at one of the dub music parties debuting around the city.

The anti-Algarve, an hour from Lisbon.

The Algarve may be chockablock with tourists and grand hotels, but hippie-chic Comporta, a protected nature reserve and former fisherman’s village in the Alentejo region, is deliberately underdeveloped and teeming with creative European A-listers. This year its only major hotel — [Sublime Comporta,](http://sublimecomporta.pt/hotel-overview.html) with rustic rooms and suites scattered across forests of pine, cork and olive — opened a restaurant, Celeiro, inspired by the area’s old rice barns, along with 22 luxury villas.

Culture and wildlife without mass tourism — yet.

Hippos surfing waves. Elephants strolling sandy beaches. Gorillas, mandrills, sea turtles, whales. Gabon, a politically stable African country with abundant wildlife, isn’t on many must-see lists, largely because of its lack of infrastructure. It’s still challenging to move within the country and hotels are rare, but the government is working to change that. In the last five years, it has improved the country’s international airport, introduced an online visa application, established a national park system in long-protected reserves and neared completion of a national coastal road. Last year, two lodges reopened, notably [Loango Lodge](http://www.loango-safari.com/), situated at the main entry point to Loango National Park and the gorilla habituation project. And in 2017, two more lodges will open near the Langoué Bai and Lopé national parks. — Kelly DiNardo

The city’s already incredible food scene has some notable new players, including a recently opened food hall, t[he Pine Street Market](http://www.pinestreetpdx.com/), and the [first U.S. branch](http://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2016/10/3/first-look-at-tokyo-cult-afuri-ramen-opening-soon-in-southeast-portland) of the celebrated Japanese ramen chain [Afuri](http://afuri.com/). New lodgings like the [Hi-Lo](http://www.hi-lo-hotel.com/) and [Society Hotel](http://www.thesocietyhotel.com/) will transform historic structures into stylish places to stay. And the city has a new [high-tech bike-share program](https://www.biketownpdx.com/) and a [recently opened light-rail](http://catchtheorange.com/) that whisks visitors across the eye-catching bridge [Tilikum Crossing](http://catchtheorange.com/#/destinations/tilikum-crossing) and into destination neighborhoods like [Sellwood-Moreland](https://www.travelportland.com/article/sellwood-moreland-shopping/). — Dave Seminara

51.  South Bronx, New York

An industrial neighborhood’s revival.

Since the 1970s, the South Bronx has suffered in reality and reputation. But things are turning around. (Though [crime is still an issue](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/31/nyregion/bronx-murder-40th-precinct-police-residents.html) in the area, numbers are way down from heights in the early ’90s.) Openings in 2016 included[artisanal coffee shops](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/dining/coffee-shops-south-bronx.html?_r=0), galleries and boutiques like [To_Bridges](http://www.to-bridges.info/) and 9J,[La Grata](http://www.lagrata.com/) Neapolitan pizzoteca, and[Milk Burger](http://milkburger.com/). This year’s arrivals will include the Bruckner Market food hall, with a rooftop beer garden and a distillery and brewery; the Bronx Post Place retail and dining complex; Latin-inspired restaurants from the chef[Douglas Rodriguez](http://chefdouglasrodriguez.com/); and a riverfront hotel by[Somerset Partners](http://www.somersetpartnersllc.com/). — Erin Levi

52.  Ryukyu Islands, Japan

The Japan you’ve never heard of.

This rarely visited archipelago of 160 islands, with multiple endangered dialects and cultures, stretches from the southern tip of Japan’s mainland to 70 miles off the east coast of Taiwan. Expect Unesco heritage sites, 1,000-year-old cedars, the “living fossil” Amami rabbit, ancient temples and castles, white sand beaches, crystal-clear diving spots and a [tug of war festival](http://www.naha-navi.or.jp.e.ni.hp.transer.com/event/195/). There’s a new (albeit expensive) way to see them: on[an Abercrombie and Kent cruise](https://www.abercrombiekent.com/travel/?tid=6573), with rates starting at $15,495. — Daniel Scheffler

 ** Correction: January 8, 2017 **

The No. 2 entry on Page T2 about Atacama Desert, Chile, erroneously attributes a distinction to a telescope at a hotel there. It is one of the country’s largest privately owned telescopes, not its largest telescope.

 ** Correction: January 8, 2017 **

The No. 14 entry on Page T2 about Penzance, England, describes its location incorrectly. Penzance is in the southwest part of the country, not the southeast.

 ** Correction: January 8, 2017 **

The No. 17 entry on Page T2A about Sikkim, India, misstates the year an airport is scheduled to open there. It is 2017, not 2018. The entry also refers incorrectly to Sikkim’s becoming the first fully organic state in India. It happened in 2015, not in 2016.

 ** Correction: January 8, 2017 **

The No. 30 entry on Page T2B about Chiang Mai, Thailand, misstates the year the X2 Chiang Mai Riverside Hotel is scheduled to open. It is 2017, not 2018.

 ** Correction: January 8, 2017 **

The No. 31 entry on Page T2B about Napa Valley, Calif., refers incorrectly to the ownership of the restaurant Two Birds/One Stone there. It is not owned by Kenzo Estate wines, which has a winery in the area. The entry, using information from a publicist, also refers incorrectly to the opening of Las Alcobas Hotel in Napa. It is scheduled to open later in January; it did not open in December 2016.

 ** Correction: January 8, 2017 **

The No. 47 entry on Page T11 about Laikipia, Kenya, misstates the number of suites at the Arijiju, a private-home retreat in Laikipia. There are fives suites, not 10.
