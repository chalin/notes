Elliott Jin, Software Engineer @ Dropbox

“Triplebyte’s Personal touch blew me away. They spent hours talking to me so that they could match me with companies that were a great fit. I interviewed at four companies, and all made offers. I accepted Dropbox, because their strong engineering culture was what I was looking for.”

Aubrey Cutts Worthington, Software Engineer @ Flexport

“Before using Triplebyte, nobody responded to me because I was a CS grad in Australia. Triplebyte was great in contrast. I did the quiz and interview, and then got matched with a bunch of companies. I interviewed at 5 companies, and got 5 offers. I ended up accepting a job at Flexport, because they are exciting and growing really quickly.”
