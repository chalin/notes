Description

Dire Straits classic, sung and played by Josh Turner. I do not seek to be totally accurate in the licks or solos, just to get the general idea across. Guitar is a Mexican Telecaster, played through a fender Acoustasonic Junior amp.

Cabalisk  | You can tell by his facial expressions that he puts his balls inbetween the strings of the guitar and strums himself to ecstasy

Rocky Mountain Hobo  | I imagine I've seen bands do covers of sultans a hundred times or more over the years. This is as good as any I've seen. Better than most. Especially considering it's a solo. I bet you do it better now. I appreciate that you have respected the original while still being yourself.
