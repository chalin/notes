## Stop Spending So Much Time In Your Head

August 15, 2016

I know something about you without knowing you. I bet you spend A LOT of time in your head.

You know, thinking, worrying, stressing, freaking out ‚Äî call it whatever you want. I call it a preoccupied mind. And with what?

99% of your thoughts are useless. William James put it best:

> ‚ÄúA great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.‚Äù

All my life I‚Äôve been obsessed with practical things. Practical philosophy, practical knowledge, practical books, practical work, and practical advice.

That idea comes from Pragmatism, a philosophical tradition that started in the 19th century in America. Charles Sanders Peirce, who was a Harvard professor, is considered as the ‚Äúfather of Pragmatism.‚Äù

But it was William James, a trained physician turned philosopher, who really defined the philosophy.

About thoughts, worry, and stress, William James says:

> ‚ÄúThe greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another.‚Äù

Pragmatism believes that the mind is a tool. Your mind should work for you, not against you. People who don‚Äôt master their mind, don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs possible.

They say: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help but thinking these things.‚Äù
Well, you *can* with enough practice. It‚Äôs a skill.

In other words: You have the ability to decide what you think. Or, you can choose NOT to think.

And that is one of the most important and most practical things you can learn in life. Before I learned that skill, I would spend hours and hours inside my head.

Just think about how much you think.

- ‚ÄúI wonder what my boss thinks?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhat happens if I screw up and lose my job?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúDoes she love me?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI think he doesn‚Äôt care about me.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI just keep failing.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhy does my life suck?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhy is my life awesome, and other people‚Äôs lives are not?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhat if I get cancer?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about my job. Is there something wrong with me?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt finish anything. What‚Äôs wrong with me?‚Äù

And the list goes on. That is all REAL shit. That‚Äôs stuff people tell me when I ask them what they worry about.

You know what those thoughts do to you? Guilt, anger, suffering.

### **I just have one question for you: What‚Äôs the practical use of your thoughts?**

Yes? I‚Äôm waiting. Still no answer? Exactly.
Thoughts have no use. 99% of them that is.
Which thoughts are useful?

1. **Thinking about how you can solve problems. **A problem is just an unanswered question. Put your brain to use and think about how you can solve problems. There are a lot of those on this earth.

2. **Understanding knowledge.** That mean this: Try to internalize knowledge and think about how you can use that knowledge to improve your life, career, work, relationships, etc.

That‚Äôs it. You can ignore every other thought.

If you‚Äôre constantly thinking, it‚Äôs because you haven‚Äôt‚Äô trained your mind yet. You HAVE to get out of your head.

If not, you go mental. Everyone will. No exception.

Also, you‚Äôre probably thinking so much that you‚Äôre missing out of life. Did you notice the sunshine this morning when you woke up? Or the raindrops? Did you notice the smell of your coffee? Did you feel the texture of your cereals?

If your answer is no, you definitely need to get out of your head. Stop thinking and start feeling.

### **Now, you might think: ‚ÄúHow do I train myself to stop thinking useless thoughts?‚Äù**

Awareness.

That‚Äôs where it starts. Every time you start drifting off, become aware of it. Just observe your brain. Step outside yourself and just observe the crazy shit you‚Äôre thinking about.

Don‚Äôt judge. Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre stupid. If you do that, you‚Äôre thinking again.

No, what you want to do is say this to yourself: ‚ÄúAh that‚Äôs a cute thought. Now, let‚Äôs get back to reality.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúIf you can change your mind, you can change your life.‚Äù
> ‚Äï William James

Are you back to reality? Do you feel your eyes reading the letters on your screen? Do you feel your phone in your hand? Are you thinking about how you‚Äôre going to apply this information to your life?

Great. You‚Äôre USING your mind, and it‚Äôs not the other way around. Now, keep using that brain of yours.

Because I‚Äôll tell you this: It‚Äôs the most powerful tool on earth.

Darius is spot on.

Now that you‚Äôve read this article, I presume you‚Äôll be aware of why & how you need to train your brain.

NOTE: training your brain will NOT be easy.

However, it will be very valuable when it begins to help you solve problems you thought you could not solve and feel gratitude you did not think you could feel.

So, please think about what you have read here, and begin to TAKE ACTION.

I started training my brain 3 years ago; it hasn‚Äôt happened overnight; I still sometimes fail to shut out those ‚Äòvoices‚Äô and I am still learning how to avoid that happening.

But I AM GLAD I STARTED TRYING.

Imagine if you DON‚ÄôT start trying NOW. How long do you want to postpone being able to do good stuff more readily, make small but powerful changes to your career / relationships / hobbies and experience a lot less guilt, anger and suffering?!

Go forward and act! [üôÇ](../_resources/4f22736614151ae463b63a5a78aac9d9.bin)
