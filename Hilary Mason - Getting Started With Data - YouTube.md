Cesar Omiste  | data science is very much like doing theoretical physics in that it uses mathematics (statistics in the case of ds) as a tool but the real prosperous work (science) is performed using intuition and creativity.

jlastre  | I didn't have a problem with most of what Ms. Mason said until she mentioned the bit about a high correlation between people who like racing and read articles about the pope.  With all the features/variables typical with "big data" finding correlations is not a problem as they may be there just by chance. So it means nothing in and of itself.  Further mathematicians and statisticians may explore data to see what may be unusual but they will do confirmatory (more precisely, inferential) analysis before making judgements.  Something that seem to be lost on the rush to "big data"

i theenigma  | The correlation between people reading about racing and the pope seems to be perfectly in context to me. She was just demonstrating an example about intuition and how certain aspects in an analysis should stand out to you (note the contrast with her finding that people interested in racing also like cars).
