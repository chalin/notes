## How-to

- There are more than 3 billion reddit comments stored in BigQuery, ready to be analyzed (thanks [Jason Baumgartner](https://medium.com/u/3a16fa97630d?source=post_page-----c9958b5bc376----------------------)!).
- Instead of counting the number of mentions, we’ll count the number of distinct users mentioning the famous accounts — so the stats are harder to game.
- You can play with an [interactive Data Studio dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/org/aLzLLuH1QJC-2sBBmo7qdw/reporting/0ByGAKP3QmCjLVUc4b2laRzNRQ1U/page/RFtG)— find your favorite redditors and share what you your results! I added everyone that has gathered more than 800 redditors mentioning them.

# Results

## Bots on the top

![1*u5dcpip-Wit08xVUMgp_tQ.png](../_resources/863739cd17a45e8f5281d95fd7404c5b.png)

- The most famous reddit users are bots: /u/trollabot and /u/user_simulator
- Both have been mentioned by more than 90,000 redditors each.
- Both peaked at their introduction month, and never recovered to their initial popularity.

## Virtual coins

![1*Ts5-23OIa8P5QGmcmnYHTg.png](../_resources/7c10cb6ead7fcbd0fe6a38be1913e9fd.png)

- The 3rd most popular reddit account has been mentioned only by 25,000 redditors. Still, /u/dogetipbot’s popularity soared during 2013.
- In a similar category we can find /u/changetip. It’s the 7th most famous account (>10.2K mentioning).
- Both bots popularity has gone away though, as other virtual coin bots.

## The tragedy of Unidan

![1*24IhM-WPY6IOgzu4Y6JolQ.png](../_resources/01b2fec635b3ba46abff3e1c7837e1ee.png)

- Everyone loved /u/unidan back in 2013 — until his good fame reversed. The account has accumulated more than 23.9K mentioners.
- Redditors still keep mentioning Unidan around reddit — perhaps as a cautionary tale. [Don’t manipulate vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidan)s, kids!
- Unidan’s alternative account — /u/unidanx — still enjoys some popularity. At least enough to show up in this ranking, with more than 2.9K mentioners.

## The most famous reddit CEOs

![1*xaeKLGTxwe7LEeZpp3oYaQ.png](../_resources/dc0c9f5788cd0c3b70c7798af5c1d266.png)

- Usually being the CEO of reddit doesn’t make you too famous — unless a scandal breaks out.
- /u/spez has broken that trend — with a high number of mentions, even in scandal-free months.
- The first peak of mentions for any of the reddit CEOs happened back in July 2015. People weren’t too happy to see [/u/chooter leave](http://www.mediaite.com/online/reddit-fired-moderator-victoria-taylor-and-all-hell-broke-loose/).
- No other reddit CEO has been close to the number of mentioners than /u/spez got in November 2016. That was another [controversial month](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/).

## They draw

![1*Xhi5k_7GLsHQTl-J97RA2g.png](../_resources/485c06a20e17cdfe91ca257207813d9d.png)

- /u/awildsketchappeared appeared after /u/shitty_watercolour — but has been more famous since. Still, [shitty_watercolour has a wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector_Janse_van_Rensburg), and wildsketch does not.
- /u/shittywatercolour is not the right way to spell it — but still gets enough mentions to show up.

## Top contributors

![1*oJexwW1ZuUwu-ZaiEAojCA.png](../_resources/d99cfc50a089de586281819cb2c94b03.png)

- /u/gallowboob submits a lot of reddit front page posts — and people talk a lot about that.
- Before /u/gallowboob showed up the most famous contributor was /u/karmanaut. His fame has clearly dropped.

## Weird storytellers

![1*Ts5-23OIa8P5QGmcmnYHTg.png](../_resources/0ba4d2c976c4b93db6b714921d4cc38e.png)
![1*0qYmZPKdPdfR6iOpn_K0OQ.png](../_resources/2163750893b5a54ab2d19fd84b1433c2.png)

- /u/_vargas_ and /u/rogersimon10 show up with strange answers to your /r/askreddit questions. Don’t ask me why, but that gave them fame.
- People keep mentioning /u/vargas. Misspelling, I guess.

## Celebrities

![1*0P4Vb6QyBeSAfNcMB6M8Hw.png](../_resources/949d731f7dd954db9f44cc26223e1031.png)

- /u/presidentobama is famous — but not as reddit-famous as other celebrities that dedicate more of their time to reddit: Wil Wheaton, Snoop Dog, and Gov Schwarzenegger.
