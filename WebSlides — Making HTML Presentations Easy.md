### **WebSlides is really easy**

Each parent `<section>` in the #webslides element is an individual slide.

Code is clean and scalable. It uses **intuitive markup** with popular naming conventions. There's no need to overuse classes or nesting. **Making an HTML presentation has never been so fast**.

<article id="webslides">
<!-- Slide 1 -->
<section>
<h1>Design for trust</h1>
</section>
<!-- Slide 2 -->
<section class="bg-primary">
<div class="wrap">
<h2>.wrap = container (width: 90%)</h2>
</div>
</section>
</article>
