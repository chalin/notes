Description

In this video, Hilary Mason, Chief Scientist at Bitly, outlines "The Dirty, Unspoken History of Data Science" at Mortar Data's first NYC Data Science Meetup.

She gives a brief history on the emergence of data science as profession and illustrates the four key elements of what it takes to be a successful data scientist.

This was taped during Mortar Data's first NYC Data Science Meetup on February 11, 2013.

Rick Jones  | I would have called Claude Shannon the father of Information Theory, not Richard Hamming (2:49). Don't get me wrong, I think Hamming was awesome. But it was Claude Shannon who essentially started it all with "A Mathematical Theory of Communication," published in 1948 in the Bell System Technical Journal.

Other than that, I liked the talk.

DRQ  | A lot of blah with no content.  What is the education background of the people who talk about data science?

Data science started form astrophysics and finances??? Then it would be called computational science - which was that rare specialization a few years back -  until some businessmen/managers invented "data science."

No mention that a data scientist - like wine- gets better with years of experience.   NO, we don't want to say that!

And oh, no mention of computer science  - then why talk about hating Hadoop? what do you know about it? Machine learning?  Another vacuous term for many: it used to be statistical learning in informatics departments.  Now it means even hitting mindlessly a button of a canned tool to perform a K-means classification; yet, can that  so-called data scientist explain what K-means does?

Shannon is the father of information theory. See for example Coding and Information Theory by S. Roman.

And thank you for the inferred reassurance that formal education and experience are impediments to being successful.

Narendra Rana  | This is not history , its more like what do data science folks do , sort of. Misleading title.

cryora  | When the median salary is 100k+ in an age where kids are born with cell phones, of course data science is going to be sexy. Unfortunately, the drop in demand is probably due to companies deciding they don't want to pay data scientists that much and that they can probably self teach themselves the same skills with the ever more accessible technology and education (i.e. MOOC's) and reap the benefits. Just a thought.

AirScholar  | A.I. is a joke while still limited to integrated circuits. Too static and too serial.
