# spieglt/whatfiles
Whatfiles is a Linux utility that logs what files other programs read/write/create/delete on your system. It traces any new processes and threads that are created as well.

Rationale:
----------

I've long been frustrated at the lack of a simple utility to see which files a process touches from `main()` to exit. Whether you don't trust a software vendor or are concerned about malware, it's important to be able to know what a program or installer does to your system. `lsof` only observes a moment in time and `strace` is large and somewhat complicated.

Sample output:

Use:
----

*   basic use, launches `ls` and writes output to a log file in the current directory:
    
    `$ whatfiles ls -lah ~/Documents`
    
*   specify output file location with `-o`:
    
    `$ whatfiles -o MyLogFile cd ..`
    
*   include debug output, print to stdout rather than log file:
    
    `$ whatfiles -d -s apt install zoom`
    
*   attach to currently running process (requires root privileges):
    
    `$ sudo whatfiles -p 1234`
    

Compilation (requires `gcc` and `make`):
----------------------------------------

    $ cd whatfiles
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    

Questions that could be asked at some point:
--------------------------------------------

*   _Isn't this just a reimplementation of `strace -fe trace=creat,open,openat,unlink,unlinkat ./program`?_
    
    Yes. Though it aims to be simpler and more user friendly.
    
*   _Are there Mac and Windows versions?_
    
    No. Tracing syscalls on Mac requires `task_for_pid()`, which requires code signing, which I can't get to work, and anyway I have no interest in paying Apple $100/year to write free software. Process Monitor for Windows is pretty great.
    

Known issues:
-------------

*   Seems to run slowly and occasionally freeze when used to launch Firefox and Chromium. (Attaching to both with `-p [PID]` once they're running works fine.)
