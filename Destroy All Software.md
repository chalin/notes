 **The lambda calculus** is so simple that it doesn't seem to be computing at all, yet it's as powerful as any CPU.

 

 **The halting problem** is easy to state: "will a given function terminate or not?" No computer can solve it.

 

 **The Chomsky hierarchy** relates programming languages, state machines, regexes, and linguistics.

All computing systems follow these rules and many others, **both in theory and in practice**. Ten dense screencasts cover the major computational topics **using code, but no mathematical notation**.

#   [Back catalog of classic screencasts](../_resources/a6cc09b0f8d25c7f0fd57056e709fa37.bin)

The 90 classic Destroy All Software screencasts explain advanced programming practices via concrete examples: **testing**, **design**, fluency with tools like **Unix shells**, and other topics. Customers rave about their density, concision, breadth of scope, and depth of detail.

"One of the DAS screencasts (tarpipe) just taught what took a few weeks in my Operating Systems II back in college."

"The screencasts @garybernhardt makes are the kind you can rewatch every few months and learn more from each time."

— [Casey Brant](https://twitter.com/basecase/status/169509011471876098)

"This week's Destroy All Software screencast by @garybernhardt is one of the best lessons on just testing one thing ever."

#   [Subscriptions schedule and refunds](../_resources/4251d667508f36ae97e6e333e241b929.bin)

Destroy All Software subscriptions cost **$29 per month**, which grants access to both the back catalog and new releases as they happen. The **publishing schedule** is variable, but new content usually appears every two weeks.

The **format** may change over time: screencasts, text, or maybe something entirely new. This is the outlet for Gary's thoughts about software development in whatever form they take. Currently, new articles in [The Programmer's Compendium](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/compendium) are being actively published. Around May of 2017, this will switch to longer-form video in the style of the [classic screencasts](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog).

If the schedule or the format change in ways that you don't like, don't worry: Destroy All Software has always had an **unconditional refund policy**. Just cancel your subscription, then [email support](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts#mailto:support@destroyallsoftware.com) to have the most recent month's charge refunded, no questions asked.

I'm Gary Bernhardt. You know me from [Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) and, with luck, from [Boundaries](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries) or [The Birth & Death of JavaScript](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript).

These screencasts are the ones that I wish I'd had for myself: dense, 10 to 15 minute, concrete demonstrations of topics that we usually only talk about in the abstract.
