About this game

#  What is this?

We ([Julia Evans](http://jvns.ca/) and [Kamal Marhubi](http://kamalmarhubi.com/), aka [@b0rk](https://twitter.com/b0rk) and [@kamalmarhubi](https://twitter.com/kamalmarhubi)) realized that we didn't know how fast a lot of basic computer operations were (how long ** does ** an iteration of a for loop take?!?). So we made a game! Hopefully you'll come away with a better understanding of how fast your computer is.

You can find the source for all this [on GitHub](http://github.com/kamalmarhubi/one-second).
