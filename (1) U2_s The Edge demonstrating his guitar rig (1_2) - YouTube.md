adam872  | I've warmed to The Edge as a guitar player over the years. I used to think that it was all multi-tap delay and that was about it, but I've grown to appreciate the textures and the rhythmic figures he puts into U2's music (like Andy Summers did for The Police). I've come to the conclusion that he's a really under appreciated musician and for me he's by far the best thing about that band. Without him they wouldn't sound half as good.

docscholl  | Great comment from The Edge: "it's about the band", not the solo artist.

czgibson  | I respect the Edge, even though I fully understand why so many people find him annoying. There are thousands of teenage guitarists who could easily outplay him, but he has something they don't have - his own sound. You know exactly who it is as soon as you hear it. It's not difficult at all to play, but it's very difficult indeed to invent your own style like that. He has worked patiently on creating his own sound and he's made life very easy for himself as a result. It's a bit like Keith Richards, who walks on stage and plays two chord shapes for two hours and sounds effortlessly cool doing it.

It's annoying because the rest of us are thinking: why didn't I think of that first?!

macca3666  | Edge is a great guitarist, he elevates the music with the parts he comes up with, and his ear for sound and bravery with effects. He's a real servant to the songs. I've never gotten the pleasure of listening to someone wank around on the guitar showing off - I don't get steve vai, for example. Hendrix, I believe, is different.. I can listen to him play, voodoo child slight return, little wing..

Jean-Ren√© PIRLET  | He said it all, the song comes first, that's why I love him so much like Andy Summers in the Police days, and Alex Lifeson in a way, texture guitar players

Brandon Gee  | He's a bit of a sonic architect with his effects.
