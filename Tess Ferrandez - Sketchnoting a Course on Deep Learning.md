## Tess Ferrandez - Sketchnoting a Course on Deep Learning

 [ ![Tess-Fernandez-Sketchhnote.png](../_resources/60dd284c555a175171a245db9ad7c2a8.png)](https://slideshare.net/TessFerrandez/notes-from-coursera-deep-learning-courses-by-andrew-ng)

## **Tess Ferrandez created an extensive extensive set of sketchnotes on a very technical subject. We wondered… what’s the story behind them?**

*These *[*sketchnotes*](https://slideshare.net/TessFerrandez/notes-from-coursera-deep-learning-courses-by-andrew-ng)* are from a course in Deep Machine Learning by Andrew Ng. This course is one of the best in the industry, but it is very technical and math heavy, and I am a very visual learner.*

*I found myself garbling the concepts when I was just writing down the equations while listening so I decided to start over and just listen and note down and draw the core concepts instead of the details. The drawings are extremely rudimentary, but hopefully convey the essence.*

*I wasn't really expecting the amount of nice feedback and cheers I have gotten from fellow learners who use this as a supplement to the course and often say it helped them learn. And as a result, the amount of people I have connected to on Twitter, Linked In and other social media with similar interest has been beyond expectation. If I was into cheezy puns, I would call this my lucky draw.*

I certainly enjoyed looking through them and learned a thing or two along the way.

You can find Tess on Twitter [@TessFerrandez](https://twitter.com/TessFerrandez) and the full set of sketchnotes [here](https://slideshare.net/TessFerrandez/notes-from-coursera-deep-learning-courses-by-andrew-ng).

Thanks for sharing with the community Tess (both the sketchnotes and the cheezy pun).
