The course of the future – and the technology behind it June 1, 2017 Jupyter Notebooks powering Berkeley’s data science curriculum To catch a glimpse of the college course of the future, take a look at UC Berkeley’s Foundations of Data Science (Data 8) , the pioneering cours e that introduces statistics, computer science and data analysis to lower-division students of all majors. During the lecture, students can write and edit code on their laptop computers in real time, working on the same data set and code that the professor is discussing in class. Learning in the class is active, and interactive: Students can try their own calculations, using large data sets that are available at the students’ fingertips, and follow up with questions to the professor.
