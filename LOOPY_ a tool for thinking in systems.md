LOOPY: a tool for thinking in systems

In a world filled with ever-more-complex technological, sociological, ecological, political & economic systems... a tool to make interactive simulations may not be that much help. But it can certainly try.

play with simulations

It's the ancient, time-honored way of learning: messing around and seeing what happens. Play with simulations to ask "what if" questions, and get an intuition for how the system works!

programming by drawing

Raw code is too inaccessible. Also drag-and-drop is too mainstream. But with LOOPY, you can model systems by simply drawing circles & arrows, like a wee baby

remix others' simulations

Want to build upon your friends' models? Or challenge your enemies' models? LOOPY lets you have a conversation with simulations! You can go from *thinking* in systems, to *talking* in systems.

NOW PLAY WITH AN EXAMPLE:

Like duct tape, you can use LOOPY for all sorts of things:

![](../_resources/8411c4c9d3e9a0115f9528a1b305039a.png)![](../_resources/732e20c10670185dc5584a5eab4cb5a7.png)![](../_resources/6ea7bc4ba23eec6ca123804ff8998ecd.png)![](../_resources/b9fe3df6ed5e36a086b74a8d52137dcf.png)![](../_resources/c05fb22c140c103cd3e6ec0d1fda9adc.png)

However you choose to use LOOPY, hopefully it can give you not just the software tools, but also the *mental* tools to understand the complex systems of the world around us. It's a hot mess out there.
