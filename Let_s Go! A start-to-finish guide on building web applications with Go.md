Let's Go! A start-to-finish guide on building web applications with Go

# Let's Go! Learn to Build Professional Web Applications With Golang

Go is a great language for building web applications. But teaching yourself from blog posts and the standard-library documentation can often leave you with more questions than answers.

You might be wondering:

- Where can I see a concrete example of a real-world web application?
- How is it best to structure and organize my code?
- How do I make sure I’m not making any mistakes when it comes to security?
- How do I use modules to manage and version control dependencies?
- And how do I effectively test my web application?

**Let’s Go answers these questions for you — and a whole lot more.**

The book guides you through the start-to-finish build of a real-world application, so you'll gain all the knowledge, understanding and confidence you need to create production-ready applications with Go.

## Foreword

**Let's Go teaches you step-by-step how to create fast, secure and maintainable web applications using the fantastic programming language Go.**

The idea behind the book is to help you learn by doing. Together we'll walk through the start-to-finish build of a web application — from structuring your workspace, through to session management, authenticating users, securing your server and testing your application.

Building a complete web application in this way has a number of benefits. It helps put the things you're learning into context, it demonstrates how different parts of your codebase link together, and it forces us to work through the edge-cases and difficulties that come up when writing software in real-life. In essence, you'll learn more than you would by just reading Go's (great) documentation or standalone blog posts.

By the end of the book you’ll have the understanding — and confidence — to build your own production-quality web applications with Golang.

Although you can read the book cover-to-cover, it's designed specifically so you can follow along with the project build yourself.

Break out your text editor, and happy coding!

### About the Author

Hey, I’m Alex Edwards, a full-stack web developer. I began working with Golang 6 years ago in 2013, and have been teaching people and writing about the language for nearly as long.

I’ve used Go to build a variety of production applications, from simple websites (including the one you’re reading now) to high-frequency trading systems. I also work on a number of open source Go packages, including the popular session management system SCS.

I live near Innsbruck, Austria. I post regularly on [my blog](http://www.alexedwards.net/) and you can follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ajmedwards/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ajmedwards) and [Github](https://github.com/alexedwards/).
