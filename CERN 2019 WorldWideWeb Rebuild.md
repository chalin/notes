CERN 2019 WorldWideWeb Rebuild

### Hello, World

In December 1990, an application called WorldWideWeb was developed on a NeXT machine at The European Organization for Nuclear Research (known as CERN) just outside of Geneva. This program – WorldWideWeb — is the antecedent of most of what we consider or know of as "the web" today.

In February 2019, in celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the development of WorldWideWeb, a group of developers and designers convened at CERN to rebuild the original browser *within* a contemporary browser, allowing users around the world to experience the rather humble origins of this transformative technology.

### Party like it’s 1989
