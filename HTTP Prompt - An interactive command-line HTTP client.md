# Key Features

## Autocomplete

You'll never have to memorize the whole commands and HTTP headers thanks to autocomplete with fuzzy matching.

## Syntax Highlighting

Improve readability by rendering JSON, HTML and commands with [27 builtin color themes](http://http-prompt.com/themes), borrowed from [Pygments](http://pygments.org/).

## An [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/) Friend

Designed to work with and built on top of HTTPie, HTTP Prompt makes a perfect companion for HTTPie.

## Auto Cookies

Cookie-based authentication made easy as incoming cookies are automatically set into your next request.

## Unix-like Pipelines

With [pipelines](http://docs.http-prompt.com/en/latest/user-guide.html#pipeline) and [output redirection](http://docs.http-prompt.com/en/latest/user-guide.html#output-redirection), HTTP Prompt works seamlessly with your existing command line tools such as [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

## OpenAPI/Swagger Integration*

Specify an OpenAPI/Swagger specification then you'll be able to explore API endpoints with `ls` like a filesystem.
