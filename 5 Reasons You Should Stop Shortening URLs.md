A [recent paper by Cornell Tech researcher](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02734v1.pdf) Vitaly Shmatikov and independent researcher Martin Georgiev demonstrated that shortening URLs  can have serious privacy consequences. Because shortened URLs are *so* short, they are vulnerable to brute-force scanning, meaning that attackers can guess multiple shortened URLs and read all of the working ones. The researchers looked at   [Microsoft](https://www.forbes.com/companies/microsoft/)  [MSFT +0.88%](https://www.forbes.com/companies/microsoft/) OneDrive and   [Google](https://www.forbes.com/companies/google/)  [GOOGL +1.06%](https://www.forbes.com/companies/google/) maps URLs shortened using bit.ly. They found that shortened URLs shared on a cloud service are effectively public. In the case of Microsoft OneDrive, they're vulnerable to malware injection as well.

"In the case of cloud-storage services such as Microsoft OneDrive, this not only leads to leakage of sensitive documents, but also enables anyone to inject arbitrary malicious content into unlocked accounts, which is then automatically copied into all of the account owner’s devices. In the case of mapping services, short URLs reveal addresses and—via easy cross-correlation with public directories—identities of users who shared directions to medical facilities (including abortion, mental-health, and addiction-treatment clinics), prisons and juvenile detention centers, places of worship, and other sensitive locations; enable inference of social ties between people; and leak other sensitive private information," the researchers concluded.

Although Google has responded by lengthening URLs and blocking automated scanning and Microsoft no longer allows OneDrive users to share files using shortened URLs, previously shared links are still live, and the exposed data is still vulnerable. But the fact that private shortened URLs could become public is not only reason not to shorten URLs. There are others.

**Many people won't—or shouldn't—click on shortened URLs**

Sure, sometimes people shorten links because they're obsessed with analytics. But people use legitimate-looking shortened URLs, too, in order to obscure the target website and lure users into scammy or spammy pages, or even sites containing malware. Some URL shorteners allow the user (that is, the person shortening the URL) to log the target's IP address, even if the reader isn't visiting their site. So it's not a terrible idea to be wary of shortened URLs, even if many are innocuous. There are even sites (like [URLex.org](http://urlex.org/) or [CheckShortURL.com](http://checkshorturl.com/)) that offer destination previews of shortened URLs so that users can figure out that the links are, but not everyone is that patient. Many will just skip the article they'd otherwise be interested instead.

**People who do click through might feel betrayed.**

Even if you're not sharing a malicious or spammy link, or even one with multiple redirects, because users don't know where you're sending them, they may wind up on a website they typically choose not to visit. This may make them less likely to click through in the future. Use the full link and they can make an informed decision.

**You have less control over your URL if you use a URL shortening service.**

Sometimes legitimate shortened URLs are reported as spam, leading URL shortener sites to disable them. Some shortening services stop working (either temporarily or permanently), or wind up on spam blocklists.

**There are many other ways to get analytics.**

[Twitter's analytics page](https://analytics.twitter.com/) can show you how many people saw a specific tweet, how many engaged with it and in which way (e.g. likes, detail expands, replies, retweets, and hashtag clicks), and even the engagement percentage, which is the number of total engagements divided by the number of impressions.   [Facebook](https://www.forbes.com/companies/facebook/)  [FB +0.79%](https://www.forbes.com/companies/facebook/) may not offer robust analytics on profiles, but it does on Facebook pages, showing post reach, engagement, and website clicks. Even   [LinkedIn](https://www.forbes.com/companies/linkedin/)  [LNKD +0%](https://www.forbes.com/companies/linkedin/) shows you how many people viewed each of your updates. Between that, tools like [WhoSharedMyLink](http://muckrack.com/whoshared/), and various analytics options available for personal and business websites, analyzing data from URL shorteners is probably unnecessary.

**Bonus:** **Long URLs no longer take up more characters on   [Twitter](https://www.forbes.com/companies/twitter/)  [TWTR +2.03%](https://www.forbes.com/companies/twitter/) than shortened ones do.**

Shortening URLs used to help you save precious characters on Twitter, but this is no longer the case. ALL URLs are now altered to 23 characters.

TL;DR: Using the full URL promotes honesty, transparency, and good digital hygiene. Posting shortened URLs does the opposite.
