Description

Today, weâ€™re going to explore the power of declarative programming, which React has managed to popularize, and itâ€™s incredibly useful and important for almost all programmers. Donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re not a web developer, this episode is not web specific, and there is not going to be much code in this episode, and Iâ€™m not going to assume that you know what React is.
