Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel (University of Edinburgh) and Shane Wilson (Ulster University) share the results of how they implemented real-world tools to save time and boost outcomes. All teachers struggle with how to deliver feedback when students need it, and at scale. Wilson shares their story of how they increased passing rates and decreased grading time using GitHub Classroom and Travis CI. Çetinkaya-Rundel, who has used GitHub Classroom in her courses at Duke University, has taken that knowledge to build ghclass—a package for managing her Classroom on GitHub using R to enable peer evaluation. She is an advocate for using open source tools in data science and statistics.
