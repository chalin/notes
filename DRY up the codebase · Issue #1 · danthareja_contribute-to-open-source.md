### > Welcome to the experience!

> In this experience, you are a **> doer**> . You take action first, and learn about the action afterwards. This design helps you get comfortable in the unknown, an entity that is omnipresent in the coding world. If you're feeling confused, that's ok. Read the instructions carefully, trust the process, and have fun!

> To help guide you through the experience, there will be comment blocks (like the one your reading now) that explains *> just enough*>  context before your next action.

### > Open Source and GitHub

> An **> open source**>  project is any code that can be freely used, changed, and shared by anyone. An open source project usually contains a > [> license](https://choosealicense.com/)>  that declares specific terms of use. Open source projects are important because they help develop and spread great ideas and push technology forward.

**> GitHub**>  is a website that hosts open source projects. A project on GitHub is called a **> repository**>  (or **> repo**> ), a folder that holds code. GitHub allows people to collaborate on a repo through features like **> issues**>  and **> pull requests**> . By the end of this experience, you'll understand how to use these features to contribute your ideas to other projects.

### > Issues

**> Issues**>  (like this one) allow people to track and discuss any task related to the project. Issues are not always problems with the code. They can also be feature requests or questions about how to use the code.

> To help organize the project, issues can be tagged with one or more **> label**> . When you graduate from this project and are looking for more ways to contribute, look for projects with issues tagged with labels [object Object]> , [object Object]> , [object Object]> , [object Object]> , or something similarly inviting.

We're off to an amazing start disrupting the calculator industry. Our beautiful contributors burned all of last week's midnight oil to release our first version and the initial reception has been unprecedented!

After a code review from some experts, we've learned that there's some unnecessary repetition in the codebase. Removing this repetition will make our codebase easier to maintain as we continue to grow into the world's best calculator company.

The team is burnt out from last week's push and needs your help! Before blowing half of our capital investment on a vacation in the Swiss Alps, the team managed to write some tests for this refactor, and left behind a roadmap to the next big release:

- Read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/danthareja/contribute-to-open-source/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Build the project locally](https://github.com/danthareja/contribute-to-open-source/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#build-the-project-locally)
- Go to [this line](https://github.com/danthareja/contribute-to-open-source/blob/master/src/calculator.test.js#L4) and change [object Object] to [object Object]
- Run [object Object]
- Notice that the tests are failing
- Implement [[object Object]](https://github.com/danthareja/contribute-to-open-source/blob/master/src/calculator.js#L1) to make the tests pass
- Change the [object Object] to [object Object] so all the tests run
- Run [object Object] again
- Make sure that all the tests are passing
- [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/danthareja/contribute-to-open-source/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submit-a-pull-request)

| No need. As long as the styling issues are fixed, you can keep developing on Windows. |
