Enigma/Paper Enigma From Franklin Heath Ltd Wiki Jump to: navigation , search Although the Enigma cipher as a whole is quite complex (it's complexity is comparable to modern cryptographic algorithms ) the individual transformations within it are relatively simple. In fact, they are simple enough that you can decipher an Enigma message with just a paper model. Our model is three-dimensional, to illustrate the wiring of a real Enigma machine. It needs only common household items to construct, and is completely compatible with all settings of a real Enigma machine (models I, M1, M2 and M3).
