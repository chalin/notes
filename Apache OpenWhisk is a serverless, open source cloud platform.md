Apache OpenWhisk is a serverless, open source cloud platform

# Apache OpenWhisk is a serverless, open source cloud platform

 **Apache OpenWhisk** (Incubating) is a [serverless](https://openwhisk.apache.org/serverless), **open source** cloud platform that executes functions in **response to events** at any scale.

 [Get Started](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/tree/master/docs#getting-started-with-openwhisk)

##  Where to start.

With Apache OpenWhisk you can easily create actions, test, connect to other actions or debug them. Use the [Apache OpenWhisk CLI](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/docs/cli.md#openwhisk-cli), target your Apache OpenWhisk instance, and run your first action in seconds.

## Focus only on your code.

As a developer there's no need to manage the servers that run your code. Apache OpenWhisk operates and scales your application for you. Spend your time innovating, not configuring infrastructure. Plus, you only pay for what your app uses and needs at that moment.

###  Fine-grained resource consumption

![Apache OpenWhisk is cost-effective for developers](../_resources/3f52897c9e2f00c91386018c0b92d1b7.png)

Pay only for the actual resources your actions use, down to the millisecond. When an action is not running, it’s not in memory, so you don’t pay for idle resources.

###  Use any language, any service

![Apache OpenWhisk is integrates with many popular languages and apps](../_resources/f03dead8b8b1f6248038569ccb5ca3fe.png)

Work with what you know and love. Integrate popular services. Code in your favorite languages. All the pieces connect and are easy to extend.

## Plug your service into Apache OpenWhisk.

Apache OpenWhisk makes it simple for thousands of developers to integrate with your service. Make it easy for developers to perform actions when something happens in your service, or to send data into your service when things happen somewhere else.

Become part of a thriving, open source ecosystem. Get your service in the hands of more developers, and make it easier than ever for other providers to integrate with your services.

Apache OpenWhisk is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
