 At long last, an in-depth look at the mechanics of my Sultans of swing arrangement. For more arrangement tutorials, check out my other channel, JT ETC: [http://bit.ly/24MIctu](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F24MIctu&redir_token=-WUiLcq2F8CjoAgIORxpT036q1Z8MTUxNzE0NDcwOEAxNTE3MDU4MzA4&event=video_description&v=RAtzRQaoFw4)Patreon: [https://www.patreon.com/JoshTurnerGuitar](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patreon.com%2FJoshTurnerGuitar&redir_token=-WUiLcq2F8CjoAgIORxpT036q1Z8MTUxNzE0NDcwOEAxNTE3MDU4MzA4&event=video_description&v=RAtzRQaoFw4)I decided not to look at the solos in this video because they were close enough to the originals to be learned from other videos.

 Attention Humanoids. This is how lessons are best done. This isn't a tune a 4th grader would attempt so he doesn't teach it like Mr rogers would. Good job.

 I Stumbled a crossed ur cover of this when I was learning to play it , 5 or so years ago. Saw it in my suggestion , views 64k . I thought he's wearing potter glasses n dressed like he changes tires part time at Wal-Mart . I clicked n with in the first bar I perked up realizing you had 30 years of skill packed into your fingers .  Then ... Then your started to sing . I was amazed ! watched it > 5 times took note of how you used different inversions of the chord to better fit what you was doing.  I became an instant fan . Hope you make a billon dollars but I know even if you don't ur still going to do what your born to do . Your the finest n most diverse young musician  ive ever seen on here .   Thanks Josh , n continue to inspire people on your path to reinvent music.

 My passion for the guitar has gone up and down, back and forth during the last few years. But today I somehow came across your channel – and all I can say is wow! You made me realize what this instrument is all about. I haven't felt this motivated to take my guitar playing to the next level for a long time. Thank you! And I guess it goes without saying, but I'd love to see more lessons from you. You're great.

 the fact you do not change your tone or face as you state who you look like just makes this so much funnier. One of my favorite talents on youtube, keep it up man hopefully one day I will be able to play just as well as you

 Josh, you are outrageously good. And hilarious I might add. Im sixty seven and picked up the guitar a year ago. it's a new life for me. I've noticed some earlier comments are peppered with juvenile humor; rather sad to see that. But, I don't always take myself seriously either. Keep up the good work. Trains passing frequently..... Chicago?
