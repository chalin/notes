Comparative efficacy and acceptability of 21 antidepressant drugs for the acute treatment of adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis

# Comparative efficacy and acceptability of 21 antidepressant drugs for the acute treatment of adults with major depressive disorder

##

Research in context
**Evidence before this study**

Antidepressants are routinely used worldwide for the treatment of major depressive disorder, which is one of the most important global health challenges; however, in the scientific literature, there remains considerable debate about both their effectiveness as a group, and the potential differences in effectiveness and tolerability between individual drugs. With the marketing of new antidepressants and increasing numbers of trials published every year, an updated systematic review and network meta-analysis was required to synthesise the evidence in this important clinical area.

**Added value of this study**

This network meta-analysis represents a major update and extension of our previous study, which addressed 12 antidepressants with data for head-to-head comparisons only, and provides the best currently available evidence base to guide the choice about pharmacological treatment for adults with acute major depressive disorder. We now include a more comprehensive list of 21 antidepressants and placebo, consider three new clinical outcome measures and many potential effect modifiers, and use the most advanced statistical methodology for network meta-analysis to date.

**Implications of all the available evidence**

Our findings should inform clinical guidelines and assist the shared decision making process between patients, carers, and clinicians in routine practice on selecting the most appropriate antidepressant for adults with acute major depressive disorder. Future research should seek to extend network meta-analysis to combine aggregate and individual-patient data from trials in a so-called individual-patient data network meta-analysis. This analysis will allow the prediction of personalised clinical outcomes, such as early response or specific side-effects, and the estimate of comparative efficacy at multiple timepoints.

Grouped into various classes of drugs with slightly different mechanisms of action, antidepressants are widely used treatments for major depressive disorder, which are available worldwide. However, there is a long-lasting debate and concern about their efficacy and effectiveness, because short-term benefits are, on average, modest; and because long-term balance of benefits and harms is often understudied.[4](#)x4Ioannidis, JP.

## Methods

### Search strategy and selection criteria

We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS database, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, PsycINFO, AMED, the UK National Research Register, and PSYNDEX from the date of their inception to Jan 8, 2016, with no language restrictions. We used the search terms “depress*” OR “dysthymi*” OR “adjustment disorder*” OR “mood disorder*” OR “affective disorder” OR “affective symptoms” combined with a list of all included antidepressants.

We included double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antidepressants with placebo or another active antidepressant as oral monotherapy for the acute treatment of adults (≥18 years old and of both sexes) with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder according to standard operationalised diagnostic criteria (Feighner criteria, Research Diagnostic Criteria, DSM-III, DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, DSM-5, and ICD-10). We considered only double-blind trials because we included placebo in the network meta-analysis, and because this study design increases methodological rigour by minimising performance and ascertainment biases.[7](#)x7Hróbjartsson, A, Thomsen, AS, Emanuelsson, F et al.

To inform clinical practice globally, we selected the two tricyclics (amitriptyline and clomipramine) included in the [WHO Model List of Essential Medicines](http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/20th_EML2017.pdf?ua=1)). We also included trazodone and nefazodone, because of their distinct effect and tolerability profiles. Additionally, we included trials that allowed rescue medications so long as they were equally provided among the randomised groups. We included data only for drugs within the therapeutic range ([appendix pp 133, 134](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix pp 133, 134). Finally, we excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials that were incomplete or included 20% or more of participants with bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or treatment-resistant depression; or patients with a serious concomitant medical illness.

The electronic database searches were supplemented with manual searches for published, unpublished, and ongoing RCTs in international trial registers, websites of drug approval agencies, and key scientific journals in the field.[8](#)x8Furukawa, TA, Salanti, G, Atkinson, LZ et al.

We contacted all the pharmaceutical companies marketing antidepressants and asked for supplemental unpublished information about both premarketing and post-marketing studies, with a specific focus on second-generation antidepressants. We also contacted study authors and drug manufacturers to supplement incomplete reports of the original papers or provide data for unpublished studies.

Six pairs of investigators (ACi, TAF, LZA, SL, HGR, YO, NT, YH, EHT, HI, KS, and AT) independently selected the studies, reviewed the main reports and supplementary materials, extracted the relevant information from the included trials, and assessed the risk of bias. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus and arbitration by a panel of investigators within the review team (ACi, TAF, LZA, EHT, and JRG).

### Outcomes

Our primary outcomes were efficacy (response rate measured by the total number of patients who had a reduction of ≥50% of the total score on a standardised observer-rating scale for depression) and acceptability (treatment discontinuation measured by the proportion of patients who withdrew for any reason).[8](#)x8Furukawa, TA, Salanti, G, Atkinson, LZ et al.

In network meta-analysis, we used group-level data; the binomial likelihood was used for dichotomous outcomes and the normal likelihood for continuous outcomes. The study effect sizes were then synthesised using a random-effects network meta-analysis model. We accounted for the correlations induced by multi-group studies by using multivariate distributions. The variance in the random-effects distribution (heterogeneity variance) was considered to measure the extent of across-study and within-comparison variability on treatment effects. Additionally, in network meta-analysis, we assumed that the amount of heterogeneity was the same for all treatment comparisons. To assess the amount of heterogeneity, we compared the posterior distribution of the estimated heterogeneity variance with its predictive distribution.[11](#)x11Rhodes, KM, Turner, RM, and Higgins, JP.

## Results

28 552 citations were identified by the search and 680 potentially eligible articles were retrieved in full text ([figure 1](http://www.thelancet.com/cms/attachment/2119023008/2088154686/gr1.gif)figure 1). We included 421 trials from the database search, 86 unpublished studies from trial registries and pharmaceutical company websites, and 15 from personal communication or hand-searching other review articles. Overall, 522 double-blind, parallel, RCTs (comprising 116 477 patients) done between 1979 and 2016, and comparing 21 antidepressants or placebo were included in the analysis ([appendix pp 6–64](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix pp 6–64). The [appendix (pp 65–114)](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix (pp 65–114) summarises the characteristics of included studies. The mean study sample size was 224 participants (SD 186). In total, 87 052 participants were randomly assigned to an active drug and 29 425 were randomly assigned to placebo. The mean age was 44 years (SD 9) for both men and women; 38 404 (62·3%) of 61 681 of the sample population were women. The median duration of the acute treatment was 8 weeks (IQR 6–8). 243 (47%) of 522 studies randomly assigned participants to three or more groups, and 304 (58%) of 522 were placebo-controlled trials. 391 (83%) of 472 were multi-centre studies and 335 (77%) of 437 studies recruited outpatients only. 252 (48%) of 522 trials recruited patients from North America, 37 (7%) from Asia, and 140 (27%) from Europe (59 [11%] trials were cross-continental and the remaining 34 [7%] were either from other regions or did not specify). The great majority of patients had moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder, with a mean reported baseline severity score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item of 25·7 (SD 3·97) among 464 (89%) of 522 studies. Response rate was imputed in 20 608 (17·7%) of 116 447 cases. Rescue medications (typically benzodiazepines or other sedative hypnotics) were allowed in 187 (36%) of 522 studies. 409 (78%) of 522 studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. We retrieved unpublished information for 274 (52%) of the included trials. Consistent with the study protocol, the primary analysis was based on the 474 studies (comprising 106 966 patients) that used drugs within the licensed dose range (ie, the dosage approved by the regulatory agencies in the USA and Europe; [appendix pp 133, 134](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix pp 133, 134).

[Figure 2](http://www.thelancet.com/cms/attachment/2119023008/2088154687/gr2.jpg)Figure 2 shows the network of eligible comparisons for efficacy and acceptability. All antidepressant drugs, except milnacipran, had at least one placebo-controlled trial. Only levomilnacipran was not directly compared with at least another active drug in any of the networks. The [appendix (pp 139–44)](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix (pp 139–44) provides detailed results of pairwise meta-analyses. [Figure 3](http://www.thelancet.com/cms/attachment/2119023008/2088154688/gr3.jpg)Figure 3 shows the network meta-analysis' results for the primary outcomes. In terms of efficacy (432 RCTs, comprising 102 443 patients), all antidepressants were more effective than placebo, with ORs ranging between 2·13 (95% credible interval [CrI] 1·89–2·41) for amitriptyline and 1·37 (1·16–1·63) for reboxetine. In terms of acceptability (422 RCTs, comprising 99 787 patients), agomelatine (OR 0·84, 95% CrI 0·72–0·97) and fluoxetine (0·88, 0·80–0·96) were associated with fewer dropouts than placebo; by contrast, clomipramine was worse than placebo (1·30, 1·01–1·68).

Antidepressants were compared with placebo, which was the reference compound. OR=odds ratio. CrI=credible interval.

The relative efficacy of antidepressants compared with placebo is also shown for remission ([appendix pp 152, 153](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix pp 152, 153). The random-effects summary SMD for all antidepressants was 0·30 (95% CrI 0·26–0·34; p<0·0001; [appendix pp 150, 151](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix pp 150, 151). In terms of dropouts due to adverse events, all active drugs were associated with higher withdrawal rates than placebo with ORs ranging between 1·64 and 4·44, and 95% CrI excluding the null, except agomelatine (OR 1·21, 95% CrI 0·94–1·56; [appendix pp 154–55](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix pp 154–55). For the full results of the secondary outcomes see the [appendix (pp 150–55)](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix (pp 150–55).

In the analysis of response rate, 8% of the loops were inconsistent (17 of 219 loops; p value of the design by treatment test was 0·063), and also 8% of the loops were inconsistent for dropouts (16 of 210 loops; p=0·219). The median heterogeneity variances were estimated at 0·044 (95% CrI 0·028–0·063) for response and 0·040 (0·023–0·062) for dropout, suggesting moderate-to-low heterogeneity. Subgroup meta-regression analyses revealed that the use of placebo in trials was the strongest explanation of heterogeneity and inconsistency in those evaluated. Exclusion of placebo-controlled trials resulted in a 24% relative reduction in heterogeneity variance for response and 45% for dropout. Additionally, we found that smaller and older studies presented larger effects of the active interventions versus placebo (in particular for amitriptyline, bupropion, fluoxetine, and reboxetine; [appendix pp 182–96](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix pp 182–96). The year of randomisation or study precision did not materially impact on the relative treatment effects between active interventions ([appendix p 228](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix p 228). Overall, 46 (9%) of 522 trials were rated as high risk of bias, 380 (73%) trials as moderate, and 96 (18%) as low ([appendix pp 115–32](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix pp 115–32).

We also synthesised head-to-head studies separately to assess the differences between drugs. [Figure 4](http://www.thelancet.com/cms/attachment/2119023008/2088154689/gr4.jpg)Figure 4 presents these data for the primary outcomes (194 studies with at least two active groups at licensed dose and comprised 34 196 patients). Agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine were more effective than other antidepressants (ORs ranging between 1·19 and 1·96), whereas fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, and trazodone were among the least efficacious drugs (ORs ranging between 0·51 and 0·84). In terms of acceptability, agomelatine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and vortioxetine were more tolerable than other antidepressants (ORs ranging between 0·43 and 0·77), whereas amitriptyline, clomipramine, duloxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, trazodone, and venlafaxine were the antidepressants associated with the highest dropout rates (ORs ranging between 1·30 and 2·32). When all trials were considered, differences in ORs between antidepressants ranged from 1·15 to 1·55 for efficacy ([appendix p 147](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix p 147) and from 0·64 to 0·83 for acceptability ([appendix p 149](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix p 149), with wide CrIs on most of the comparative analyses. [Figure 5](http://www.thelancet.com/cms/attachment/2119023008/2088154690/gr5.jpg)Figure 5 reports the two-dimensional graphs about efficacy and acceptability in all studies and head-to-head studies. Results for the secondary outcomes were in line with the findings for the primary outcomes ([appendix pp 197–230](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix pp 197–230). Within the head-to-head comparisons, when a treatment was the novel or experimental drug of comparison, it appeared to be significantly more effective than when that same treatment was the older or control drug of comparison (difference 1·18-times, 95% CrI 1·09–1·27). Adjusting for this novelty effect diminished the differences between antidepressants.

#### Figure 4

Head-to-head comparisons for efficacy and acceptability of the 21 antidepressants

Drugs are reported in alphabetical order. Data are ORs (95% CrI) in the column-defining treatment compared with the row-defining treatment. For efficacy, ORs higher than 1 favour the column-defining treatment (ie, the first in alphabetical order). For acceptability, ORs lower than 1 favour the first drug in alphabetical order. To obtain ORs for comparisons in the opposite direction, reciprocals should be taken. Significant results are in bold and underscored. The certainty of the evidence (according to GRADE) was incorporated in this figure ([appendix pp 231–65](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix pp 231–65).

We incorporated the GRADE judgments in [figure 4](http://www.thelancet.com/cms/attachment/2119023008/2088154689/gr4.jpg)figure 4. The certainty of evidence for the relative treatment effects of efficacy and acceptability varied; it was moderate for most of the comparisons involving agomelatine, escitalopram, citalopram, and mirtazapine, and low to very low for most comparisons involving vortioxetine, nefazadone, clomipramine, bupropion, and amitriptyline ([appendix pp 231–65](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix pp 231–65).

In accordance with the review protocol, we also did a sensitivity analysis, including all the studies that used the drugs within the accepted doses (ie, doses recommended in some international clinical guidelines; [appendix pp 133, 134](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix pp 133, 134) and the results did not change substantially ([appendix p 187](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix p 187).

## Discussion

This study is based on 522 double-blind studies, which included 116 477 patients randomly assigned to 21 individual first-generation and second-generation antidepressant drugs or placebo.

We found that all antidepressants included in the meta-analysis were more efficacious than placebo in adults with major depressive disorder and the summary effect sizes were mostly modest. Some antidepressants, such as escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, agomelatine, and sertraline had a relatively higher response and lower dropout rate than the other antidepressants. By contrast, reboxetine, trazodone, and fluvoxamine were associated with generally inferior efficacy and acceptability profiles compared with the other antidepressants, making them less favourable options. To make our results as relevant and robust as possible to inform clinical practice, we decided to focus on head-to-head studies and at the same time emphasise the certainty of the retrieved evidence. Our assessment overall found few differences between antidepressants when all data were considered, while there was more diversity in the range of efficacy and dropout patterns seen across the head-to-head comparisons than the meta-analysis of antidepressants versus placebo.

The present findings in adults contrast with the efficacy of antidepressants in children and adolescents, for which fluoxetine is probably the only antidepressant that might reduce depressive symptoms.[21](#)x21Cipriani, A, Zhou, X, Del Giovane, C et al.

Estimated differences between drugs were smaller in placebo-controlled trials than in head-to-head studies. There are several potential explanations, as many factors have been associated with higher placebo response rates, such as randomisation ratio and the expectation of receiving an active treatment, the therapeutic setting, or the frequency of study visits.[24](#)x24Rutherford, BR and Roose, SP.

Moreover, for the same drug and the same probability of receiving placebo, larger all-cause dropout rates were associated with a lower response to treatment.

Antidepressants usually take full effect only after weeks of treatment; therefore, participants who dropped out earlier tend to have poorer responses than those who remain on treatment, which are carried forward to the end of the trial by the LOCF analysis. The final result can be an underestimate of the true efficacy of the active drug.

Another possible explanation could be a bias in conduct, analysis, or reporting of head-to-head trials, driven by commercial interests.[27](#)x27Perlis, RH, Perlis, CS, Wu, Y, Hwang, C, Joseph, M, and Nierenberg, AA.

However, non-industry funded trials were few and many trials did not report or disclose any funding. We also observed that drugs tended to show a better efficacy profile when they were novel and used as experimental treatments than when they had become old. This novelty effect might arise where a novel agent is perceived to be more effective and better tolerated; alternatively, selective analyses and outcome reporting bias might be more prominent when a treatment is first launched.[16](#)x16Salanti, G, Dias, S, Welton, NJ et al.

According to the GRADE framework, the quality of many comparisons was assessed as low or very low for amitriptyline, bupropion, and venlafaxine, whereas it was often rated as moderate for agomelatine, escitalopram, and mirtazapine. We incorporated the certainty of evidence in the main results of our analysis to highlight the most robust findings for further use in clinical judgment. However, many trials did not report adequate information about randomisation and allocation concealment, which restricts the interpretation of these results. To increase the methodological rigour of the contributing evidence, we included only double-blind trials, which were generally very similar in design and conduct. The poor information in terms of risk of bias assessment might be a matter of reporting; however, we presented full details about the risk of bias of all included studies in the [appendix (pp 115–32)](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1)appendix (pp 115–32). We did not do a formal cost-effectiveness analysis. All of the most effective antidepressants are now off patent and available in generic form. Some of the antidepressants are included in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, which makes them available worldwide and ready to use also in developing countries.

We analysed only average treatment effects and were not able to investigate potentially important clinical and demographical modifiers of treatment response at the individual patient level (eg, age, sex, severity of symptoms, or duration of illness). Patients recruited in randomised trials tend to be highly selected and we also excluded patients with psychotic or treatment-resistant depression, which might limit the applicability of the results to these clinical subgroups, but it was intended as a methodological strength to assure transitivity in the network. We did not cover important clinical issues that might inform treatment decision making in routine clinical practice (eg, specific adverse events, withdrawal symptoms, or combination with non-pharmacological treatments). Additionally, because of the paucity of information reported in the original studies, we were not able to quantify some outcomes, such as global functioning. It should also be noted that some of the adverse effects of antidepressants occur over a prolonged period, meaning that positive results need to be taken with great caution, because the trials in this network meta-analysis were of short duration. The current report summarises evidence of differences between antidepressants when prescribed as an initial treatment. Given the modest effect sizes, non-response to antidepressants will occur. Our information unfortunately cannot guide next-step choices after failure of such a first step (ie, they do not apply to treatment-resistant depression), for which well performed trials are scarce.[29](#)x29Furukawa, TA, Akechi, T, Shimodera, S et al.

Using the data made available on the websites of the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, on the international trial registries, and from contacting study authors and pharmaceutical companies, we managed to incorporate in the analysis a considerable amount of unpublished data for some drugs—namely, agomelatine, escitalopram, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, vilazodone, and vortioxetine—but not for all the antidepressants included in the network meta-analysis. This limitation in the primary trials might affect the validity of the findings for some antidepressants, but the incorporation of both direct and indirect comparisons might have contributed to reduce the potential risk of bias.[30](#)x30Furukawa, TA, Miura, T, Chaimani, A et al.

There are online archives where trials are prospectively registered; however, they collect reliable information only about the most recent studies and we cannot rule out the possibility that some studies are absent or the same study has been counted twice in our analyses. It is not uncommon for the same study to go by different names in different publications, which complicates the process of data synthesis.[31](#)x31Wager, E. The need for trial identifiers.

Notwithstanding these limitations, the findings from this network meta-analysis represent the most comprehensive currently available evidence base to guide the initial choice about pharmacological treatment for acute major depressive disorder in adults.
