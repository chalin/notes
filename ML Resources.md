ML Resources

Now that the "Tensorflow and deep learning, without a PhD" session is complete, it can be used as a crash-course on deep learning and Tensorflow. People on Twitter tell me it's one of the resources that helped them "get it". I am readying a blog post about it.

If you have 1 hour: watch this presentation while following the slide deck (annotated; be sure to view the notes). This instalment covers dense and convolutional networks.

If you have 3 hours (recommended; recurrent networks are worth it!): watch this presentation. You will need both slide decks, Part 1 and Part 2. (Again, view the notes while following along.)
