## Our 3D Printers

## Original Prusa i3

MK3S
![](../_resources/d10e2eb60b230897499adda479eb0206.png)

The Original Prusa I3 MK3S is the successor to the award-winning Original Prusa i3 MK2/S 3D printer. With the **rebuilt extruder**, a plethora of sensors and the new **magnetic MK52 heatbed with replaceable PEI spring steel print sheet,** we believe that we've developed our best 3D printer yet!

## Original Prusa

MINI
![Untitled-1.png](../_resources/f961275baefa1a1d14db0ef5ada41eea.png)

Introducing our new **smart and compact 3D printer** with all the bells and whistles you would expect from the creators of the award-winning Original Prusa i3 MK2 and MK3S! With replaceable spring steel sheets and plenty of useful features, the MINI is a **big printer in a compact body!**

## Original Prusa

SL1
![](../_resources/224c110c501b78a49fb2cddf8574ccf1.png)

Original Prusa SL1 3D printer is based on the **MSLA printing process**. Unlike Original Prusa i3 machines, this printer uses a **high-resolution LCD panel** and a UV LED to cure thin layers of resin to achieve an **unprecedented** level of detail. **Curing and Washing Machine** available separately.

Multi material
![](../_resources/2e017b6240bc5a6c153151aa7d2949fd.png)

Original Prusa i3 MK3 Multi Material 2S is a completely unique consumer option allowing to print with up to **5 different materials simultaneously.** The enhanced version 2S (available for MK3 and MK2.5) is much simpler than original MMU, which makes it **easier to use** and less sensitive to the quality of filament.

### Basics of 3D printing E-book

This book will help you understand **what kinds of 3D printing technologies** are currently available and how they work. We will take you through the whole process of 3D printing, starting with obtaining a printable 3D model, through the pre-printing preparations, to the final post-processing of a printed object. You will learn what an extruder is, as well as slicing, perimeters or infill. We’re going to explain the differences between commonly used materials, and how to utilize 3D printing for practical application. This book will give you a very good understanding of 3D printing and also provide you with all the basic knowledge required to start. The only thing remaining will be to buy a 3D printer and start printing!

[See what's inside...](https://www.prusa3d.com/ebook-basics-of-3d-printing-with-josef-prusa/)

- **60+ pages about 3D printing**
- Material guides
