I just stumbled on this map that we first posted (via Digg) [in 2008](http://mentalfloss.com/article/19334/6-crazy-things-i-just-learned-about-metric-system). The map may have used as its source the [*Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook*](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/appendix-g.html), which in 2006 said this about The Axis of Medieval:

> "At this time, only three countries—Burma, Liberia, and the US—have not adopted the International System of Units (SI, or metric system) as their official system of weights and measures."

We should point out that even these three countries do use elements of the metric system. And Burma's (Myanmar's) Deputy Minister for Commerce says his country is taking steps to adopt it officially.

For a look at the struggle to get Americans to think in meters, here's a story we ran on the [sole employee of the U.S. Metric Program](http://mentalfloss.com/article/50160/years-ken-butcher-was-sole-employee-us-metric-program).

The holiday season is all about unity, but few topics are more divisive than which Christmas movie is the ultimate seasonal film. For every *[Home Alone](http://mentalfloss.com/article/60262/25-things-you-might-not-know-about-home-alone)* fan, there’s an [*Elf*](http://mentalfloss.com/article/60421/21-things-you-might-not-know-about-elf)enthusiast. To settle the score, the folks at online TV service provider[CableTV.com](http://www.cabletv.com/blog/states-favorite-holiday-movie-map/) have collected the top-rated yuletide films as rated [over at AMC](http://www.amc.com/movie-guide/christmas-movies), and cross-referenced them with Google Trends state data from the past 10 years. They crunched the data, and compiled it into a map of each state’s favorite holiday flick.

Residents of Connecticut, Illinois, New York, and Vermont liked films set in their home states: *Christmas in Connecticut*, *Home Alone* (filmed in [Winnetka, Illinois](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-home-alone-house-winnetka-20151106-story.html)), *It’s a Wonderful Life* (set in the fictional city of [Bedford Falls, New York](http://time.com/4596666/bedford-falls-true-story/)), *and White Christma*s (set in the fictional town of [Pine Tree, Vermont](http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/local/2014/12/24/white-christmas-imaginary-vermont-town/20767323/)) all came out on top in those states, respectively.

As for Southern residents, they preferred Christmas cartoons and comedies, like *National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation*, *Home Alone*, *A Charlie Brown Christmas*, and *How the Grinch Stole Christmas*. In New England, movie fans kept it cozy with the classics, including *White Christmas* and *Miracle on 34th Street*. Pockets of the Midwest appreciated *National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation*, and residents of the Atlantic Seaboard and the Great Lakes region liked *Home Alone* and *Elf*. And out West, the *Nightmare Before Christmas* reigned supreme.

Check out the full results in the map above.

Each Country's Tourism Slogan, Mapped

Countries are not products, so it's weird to think of having to "sell" them, but that's exactly what tourist bureaus exist to do. In order to entice potential travelers, many countries have taken a cue from the corporate world and adopted their very own slogans.

[FamilyBreakFinder ](https://www.familybreakfinder.co.uk/holidays/map-every-countrys-tourism-slogan/)decided to compile a list of all the known tourist slogans and throw them onto one big map. Each of the grey countries shown have an official slogan, while the purple countries do not. Some are vague (like the United States's "All within your reach"), some are enthusiastic (like Brazil's "Brasil—sensational!"), and some are confident (like Uganda's "You're welcome").

If you know of a slogan that's not on the map, let us know in the comments.
