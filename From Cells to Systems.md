From Cells to Systems An explorable explanation of cellular automata. Written by @SpacieCat for #ExplorablesJam 2018. Introduction NOTE: Please use this site in landscape mode, portrait mode won't work properly! Hi there, thanks for checking out my first explorable thing! This was made for a jam event during exams, so there might be a few spelling errors. Part 1 : Cells So, you want to simulate a universe? Great!
