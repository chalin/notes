[En español](https://www.aarp.org/espanol/dinero/presupuesto-y-ahorro/info-2019/como-escribir-testamento-internet.html?intcmp=AE-MON-TOESP-TOGL) | My great-uncle, a bachelor and bon vivant, wrote his will on a cocktail napkin. It probably took less than 15 minutes to complete. When he died 14 years later, at age 90, the will was ruled valid in his state because it was properly witnessed by two people at a bar.

But you can write your will quickly and inexpensively without resorting to a napkin.

Laurie Macdonald, 66, had put off writing a will for years when she discovered FreeWill, a no-fee, online will-writing service. The former Florida program director of Defenders of Wildlife had once begun drafting a will with an attorney but never finished. FreeWill allowed her to get it done, Macdonald says: “It took more than 15 minutes, though probably not more than half an hour.”

### Why bother?

Die without a will, and your state's laws determine who gets your assets — your bank accounts and everything else. A will is where you can make sure your camera collection goes to your nephew and your jewelry is divided among your daughters. Most important, if you have young children, a will is also where you can name a guardian for them should you die before they reach adulthood.

"For many people, state laws don't exactly meet their needs,” says attorney Paul Kassabian, legal product counsel at LegalZoom, which offers online will-writing packages. Macdonald's longtime partner, for one, wouldn't inherit anything at Macdonald's death if there were no will. Still, many people die without this document, leaving their heirs to battle over their estates. And you don't need to have Aretha Franklin's millions for such fights to get nasty.

### **It's easy to put off …**

Forty-five percent of Americans 55 and older don't have a will, according to a new survey from Merrill Lynch and Age Wave. Why might that be? In 2017, when Caring.com, a senior-care resource, asked adults without a will why that was so, the most common answer was, “I just haven't gotten around to it.” The arrival of children didn't seem to have much impact: Only 36 percent of respondents with children under 18 had end-of-life plans in place.

### **… But easy to get done**

Do-it-yourself sites and software can smooth the process. Says Macdonald about FreeWill, for instance: “It was really clear, really simple.” Supported by nonprofit organizations that might benefit from philanthropic commitments made in wills generated at its site, FreeWill has produced more than 27,000 wills since 2017; Rocket Lawyer says it has created over a million.

### **State laws matter**

If you don't follow all the local formalities, your will may not be legally valid. A lot can go wrong. In New York, witnesses need to include their residential addresses. In Utah, handwritten wills must be penned entirely by the person making the will. And in Louisiana, wills must be signed in the presence of a notary public. Find links to your [state's laws](https://statelaws.findlaw.com/estate-planning-laws/wills.html).

### **Avoid these goofs**

Put your funeral wishes in your will and you may not get the send-off you planned. “Your will may not even be found until after you're buried,” cautions Kevin Flatley, an attorney and author of *The Little Blue Book of Estate Planning*. Another common error is naming someone your executor without asking if he or she wants the job. Finally, retirement account assets, life insurance and annuities don't pass down via wills. Beneficiary-designation forms rule here. If they're not up to date, your ex-spouse could end up inheriting against your wishes.

### **See an attorney**

If you have significant assets, children from multiple marriages or complicated business arrangements, you may need professional legal help. “There are a lot of variables, and it's easy for a layperson to overlook something,” says Flatley, noting that a will by itself may not be sufficient.

### **Low-bill wills**

Where to go for a will when on a budget:

- [FreeWill](https://www.freewill.com/) This no-cost service also allows you to draw up a new will gratis if your wishes or circumstances change.
- [LegalZoom](https://www.legalzoom.com/) Services range from a $69 will to a $149 package that includes a living trust and related documents.
- [Quicken WillMaker Plus 2019](https://www.nolo.com/) This $80 software package can create a will and other estate-planning paperwork.
- [Rocket Lawyer](https://www.rocketlawyer.com/) A membership giving you access to estate-planning documents is $40 per month.

I am a 68 year old man without a will.  Can aarp advise me as to finding a lawyer in my area (specializing in wills) to help me with my will?  I have tried to find a web site that would rate attorneys in my area, but have been unable to find any. I am not asking aarp to suggest a lawyer, but only advise on the means to find a good one.

I am single, have no spouse, ex-spouse, or children.  I do have a brother, and I'm sure that he won't have any problems serving as executor of my will.  But if he predeceases me, whom should I appoint?  I hesitate to burden any of my friends, because it would be a lot of work to dispose of the contents of my house, and sell my car and my house.  It would be easier, of course, to dispose of my stocks and bonds.  Do executors get paid?  Do I need to specify a payment in my will? Now, let's say that my brother dies and later I die, and my executor is my accountant, how does my will get executed?  I mean, who would know to start the process?  I doubt if my accountant is paying attention.

I wish this article had spent time talking about how to avoid probate.  Wills alone will not do that.

One way to do that is to set up a revocable living trust and then title your property (house, car, boat, other real estate, etc.), your bank accounts and any brokerage accounts in the name of the trust.  Then your will lists your beneficiary as the trust (it's called a pour over will because it pours over all other non-titled property and household goods and cash into the trust).  Your trust then spells out how the trust is to be distributed upon your death.  Since the trust is not a person and it is not an estate it does not go through probate.

Another way to do this is to make sure all of your titled assets list PODs (Pay On Death) or beneficiaries or list co-owners with rights of survivorship.  This is free to do but there are drawbacks to these, especially with more complex estates or more complex beneficiary plans.

Wills are not the panacea many people think they are.  First, for most people, wills will absolutely not avoid probate for your estate.  There are 2 kinds of probate: Formal and informal.  Formal is when the probate goes through court proceedings and this can be very expensive.  Informal is when the estate value falls below the financial and property level that the state sets for formal probate and are usually still filed with the court but the executor is legally authorized to manage the will without court proceedings.

Second, wills are not the final word.  State probate or estate laws ALWAYS take precedence over wills.  For instance, many states give surviving spouses special protections in estate settlements that take priority over any beneficiaries listed in the will.  My step-father-in-law's estate was worth about $175K.  His will gave 50% of it to my mother-in-law and split 50% of it between his 3 kids.  However, state law stipulated that surviving spouses are entitled to getting the first $150K from the estate BEFORE there are any distributions to any beneficiaries.  So, she ended up getting that $150K + $12.5K (50% of the $25K rthat remained) and each of his 3 kids got about $4K.  His kids were mad as heck and kept screaming that this was a violation of his will.  But, no, the will was not in compliance with state law.

If you are going to leave everything to your spouse then you can probably get away without an attorney drawing up the will.  But if you are planning to give away some of your estate to others, then it is best to get a good estate or probate attorney to draw it up because they will know what the state laws are and will make sure the laws are complied with.

For myself, I have no children, wish to leave my siblings nada, and my cause would be to incent a youth or youths to go to college, knowing my estate would pay off their student loans commencing with the 10th month after graduation. I do not foresee having a sizable estate and likely would only be able to help one or two students. How does one leave an estate to a charity that does not exist? Must I create one? It is this one piece that no longer makes my will simple.

Must a will be redone to the standards of any state I live in in the future?

I had also read that a will can be filed with court, so it's location is known.

Commenting on other comments: When I wrote my first will in my late 20s, I did it through a lawyer, and it was relatively simple. There was a statement in there that my mother could inherit only as much as she could without losing Medicaid. She was in her late 60s and receiving retirement benefits low enough to get SSI too. If it turned out that was only $1500 or $2000, then so be it, and was better than nothing. I believe I directed the rest to go to a charity. I specifically disinherited any siblings, known and unknown. I never foresaw genealogy sites using kits but feared more half siblings through my father.

I wish the attorney had said, "If you would like to help you mother to the maximal extent, let me tell you about third-party special needs trusts." I would have taken him up on it. My mother is now in a nursing home, basically warehoused, and how great it would have been to set it up and hire visitor(s) to watch a movie with (she cannot operate a VCR or DVDs) with money either she or I could have been salting away in first-party and third-party SNTs for the last 20 years. Or, take her out for air on the deck or investigate what activities are offered and entice her to give them a try. The duties would be similar to what Senior Companion volunteers do, except no transportation to restaurants, but arranging to substitute a meal with her favorite take-out. Anything that would make her life more meaningful now. I am unclear if a will can establish a third-party trust, but it seems an established one could receive assets from a will.

There may be a more ideal vehicle because first-party SNTs have a Medicaid payback provision. Or, limit what is in there, understanding the use it, or lose it, nature.

[@cc84374458]() Wills cannot establish a SNT.  They can, however, request the executor to establish one per the parameters spelled out in the will and list the SNT as a beneficiary.  I believe the name of the SNT also needs to be spelled out in the will because beneficiaries need to be named.

Every state has different rules and regulations regarding SNTs so unless you know what you are doing you probably should have an attorney draw up your will and the verbiage so it doesn't become a problem later.

I agree with the NY lawyer. Additionally, it's not just what is in the will but how it is signed and witnessed and how that is proven in court. My state, most states probably, allows the witnesses to sign an affidavit  to satisfy the probate requirements of proving the Will. Without the affidavit, you have to present the witnesses in court and the Executor may not know who these folks are. See a lawyer; it's your estate and your family that will suffer otherwise. Plus you can use an on-line will preparation software to print out what to take to your lawyer. That saves a lot of time and some money.

Hi there! I am an attorney licensed to practice in the state of NY, I live in the boonies in the Finger Lakes region, and here's my take on this subject: you cannot do a proper will from any online source or software, although you will get something that looks nice and seems OK but it ain't. I get a lot of clients that come in with this stuff and ask me to untangle it, but it's usually too late. A really good lawyer will do a will for you pretty cheap. I would and do. I'll make my money probating your will and if  you screw it up, it's going to cost your estate plenty. During a very busy period, my own wife used Legal Zoom, (or as we in the trade call it, Legal Doom) and what she got for her will was a joke. But here's another disclaimer...

I actually do use Quicken Willmaker when I'm drafting a new will for a client, because it correctly asks the basics and delivers an editable document, then I export it to a MS Word fille so I can edit and add the most important stuff which it doesn't, you know, like simultaneous death clauses, tax exemptions...I won''t give away my "secrets", you need a flesh & blood attorney that you can build trust with. So...

Ask around. Ask your friends and family. We lawyers get a bad rap, and truth be told, there are too many out there hungry for a dime, and that ain't right. We should be like doctors, and in some sense, we are.

Burying "If you have significant assets, children from multiple marriages or complicated business arrangements, you may need professional legal help. 'There are a lot of variables, and it's easy for a layperson to overlook something,' says Flatley, noting that a will by itself may not be sufficient." is a disservice to your readers.

[@RobertG808369]() Unfortunately, the quoted price of $149 is for the Will/Trust Complete package and not the Living Trust.  This may have been an oversight on the part of AARP.  I'm guessing it wasn't intentional.  Even at $249, the Living Trust bundle is still a bargain.

If you do an online will, make sure the heirs know where it is or how to access it! My will is handwritten on a Burger King napkin and stored in a mayonnaise jar in my freezer.

this is good advice.  I had a will drawn up when I owned a house, which I sold, so my will is not up to date.  As for bank accounts, have the bank add Payable on Death and the person's name.  Costs Nothing!  Your insurance should always be checked (once a year) and updated as needed.  If you own a car, add someones name but use the term or not and ( Not Richard and Joan, but Richard or Joan).  Just a few suggestions.

It costs more, but unless you have a fine grasp of inheritance laws in yourstate it's best to have an attorney to write your will and to have it witnessed and notarized, and getting it written sooner while it's optional is better than having it done later when it's critical.  Watching a survivor 'go hog' is like watching an eighteen wheeler run over a bicycle.  Once it starts there's nothing anyone can do or say to stop it and it's ugly to watch.

[@DebraF116376]() Thank you, Debra, for this excellent advice. There are so many factors to consider.   Further, it's not only the relative simplicity of your own estate that's in question but also the circumstances of those whom you may be trying to help through your will.  As an example, a bequest to someone who was in good health when you wrote your will but subsequently had a medical event that landed him in a nursing home for more years than his life savings could support would likely find himself suddenly ineligible for the Medicaid coverage on which he has come to depend, because of your bequest, if not handled correctly in your will.

Make the attorney affordable by being as fully prepared for your meetings as possible.  But do get an attorney if there is any way you can.
