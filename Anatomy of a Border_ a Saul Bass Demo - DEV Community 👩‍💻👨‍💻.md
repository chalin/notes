I‚Äôm in the process of redesigning my website and I was about to do yet another layout using geometric fonts and rounded edges when a friend of mine said that I‚Äôm a person that loves modern aesthetics but also enjoy objects with personality and attitude. He suggested that I look at Saul Bass‚Äôs work, most notably the artwork for Anatomy of a Murder. The edges of the boxes had a wonderfully geometric yet ‚Äúbroken‚Äù quality that I wanted to see if I could emulate with CSS clipping paths.

The challenge at first for me was that creating the clipping paths required percentages in order to have the path scale. At first I thought the only way to get around this would be to create an SVG file and reference it in the CSS, but quickly realized I could just use the `calc()` function to subtract a defined unit of measurement from the edge of the right and bottom edges of the div.

Now that I have my proof of concept, my next step is creating a Sketch file to start planning my *actual* website in this style!
