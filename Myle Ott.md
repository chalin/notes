# About Me

I received my Ph.D. in C.S. from Cornell in August 2013. I worked in Cornell's [Natural Language Processing group](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/NLP/) under the advisement of [Claire Cardie](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/). Now I'm a Research Scientist at Facebook.

I'm also a [Jack Kent Cooke Foundation](http://www.jkcf.org/) scholar and a graduate of the [Early Entrance Program](http://www.calstatela.edu/academic/eep/).

# Research Overview

My work in the area of opinion analysis explores how honesty and sentiment are expressed in online social media text, with an emphasis on detecting **deceptive opinion spam**â€”fictitious opinions that have been deliberately written to sound authentic, in order to deceive the reader. My work in this area has produced the first [publicly available](http://myleott.com/op_spam) gold standard corpus of deceptive opinion spam, shown the efficacy of training supervised text classifiers to detect deception, and introduced a Bayesian framework for obtaining community-level estimates of the rates of deception in online review portals, e.g., TripAdvisor and Yelp. A demo of our deception research is available at [ReviewSkeptic.com](http://reviewskeptic.com/).

My work in the area of information retrieval focuses on improving search within collections of short documents, e.g., tweets, by exploiting term co-occurrence ("topic modeling") in conjunction with explicit topic indicators, e.g., hashtags, to improve topic identification and relevance assessment. This work has been applied at IBM Research for entry into [NIST's Text REtrieval Conference (TREC 2012)](https://sites.google.com/site/microblogtrack/2012-guidelines).
